Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.040 --> 00:08.310
Now the last lecture we combined two programs into one program that improved both the programs and that's

00:08.310 --> 00:13.590
something that's called refactoring refactoring means to go over your old code and make improvements

00:13.740 --> 00:16.920
with the things you've learned along your programming journey.

00:16.920 --> 00:22.230
So as I've said before in previous lectures getting your code doing what you need to do is your top

00:22.230 --> 00:27.550
priority but there will come a point when your code will work and you'll recognize it can be improved.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.590
And this is when refactoring comes in.

00:29.790 --> 00:34.120
Refactoring makes your code cleaner easier to understand and easier to extend.

00:34.120 --> 00:39.450
So when you're finished of course don't be afraid to revisit your old programs and see if and how you

00:39.450 --> 00:40.590
can improve them.

00:40.590 --> 00:42.400
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
