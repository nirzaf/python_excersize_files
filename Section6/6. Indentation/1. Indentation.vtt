Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:03.110 --> 00:09.670
Now as we've seen the last few programs the for loop and the line of indented code is part of that loop.

00:09.720 --> 00:15.240
Furthermore pite news indentation to know when one line of code is connected to the line above it.

00:15.500 --> 00:20.630
As you write longer and more complicated programs you'll begin to see a code indented at a few different

00:20.630 --> 00:21.500
levels.

00:21.630 --> 00:26.390
Pide an indentation helps you to write clean and neatly formatted code.

00:26.390 --> 00:31.260
Also as you begin to write code that requires proper indentation mistakes will start to creep in.

00:32.710 --> 00:36.070
Let's look at some common mistakes and indentation errors to avoid

00:38.920 --> 00:42.720
forgetting to indent or forgetting to indent additional lines.

00:42.940 --> 00:48.010
Most of the time if you forget to indent Khaitan and your ID will remind you there will be times when

00:48.010 --> 00:51.340
your program is run but you will not get the results you expected.

00:51.340 --> 00:55.540
In some cases this can happen when you have forgotten to indent some of your loops lines.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.700
How about indenting unnecessarily.

00:59.040 --> 01:03.940
If you accidentally indent a line that doesn't need to be you're going to hear about it from Spuyten.

01:04.030 --> 01:09.400
Sometimes you can indent unnecessarily after the loop if you accidentally indent code that you want

01:09.400 --> 01:10.910
to rule on after the loop is finished.

01:10.990 --> 01:14.100
Then that code will be repeated once for each item in the list.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.930
More often than not you will receive a logical error.

01:16.930 --> 01:22.330
If this happens forgetting the code on this the one that I am most guilty of the code on at the end

01:22.330 --> 01:26.050
of a four statement tells me that the next line is the start of a loop.

01:26.330 --> 01:30.850
I hope this was helpful and refer back to this if you have any indentation errors in the future.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.610
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
