Learn Python 3 For Beginners : Python Programming Tutorial - Hi everybody and welcome to beginners Quickstart Guide to.

1
00:06.110 --> 00:08.110
First thank you for your interest in this course.

2
00:08.130 --> 00:09.480
I really do appreciate it.

3
00:10.410 --> 00:12.230
Now comes the question why.

4
00:12.450 --> 00:14.310
Let me answer that for myself.

5
00:14.310 --> 00:19.090
I have studied seven programming languages my career and each time I've stopped.

6
00:19.110 --> 00:26.050
Just past the basics except with piking is beautifully simple and yet incredibly powerful.

7
00:26.060 --> 00:28.480
It is also easy to read which I love.

8
00:28.580 --> 00:32.930
All of these things help make the learning curve applying much much easier.

9
00:32.980 --> 00:34.220
Order languages.

10
00:34.290 --> 00:39.350
Politeness is very easy to learn which means at no time and you'll be past the basics and learning a

11
00:39.350 --> 00:40.980
new valuable skill.

12
00:40.990 --> 00:42.810
Python is used for many purposes.

13
00:42.820 --> 00:48.420
Video games web apps business tools and most recently very heavily in data science.

14
00:48.440 --> 00:53.210
This course is a step by step guide true to Python for a programming language.

15
00:53.210 --> 00:59.060
Each lecture is built on top of the last and almost every lecture contains a program for you to try.

16
00:59.300 --> 01:04.040
In the past the reason why I have failed to learn a programming language is because I did not stick

17
01:04.040 --> 01:04.650
at it.

18
01:04.730 --> 01:06.870
You will not have that problem.

19
01:06.890 --> 01:09.660
Not only is python quick and easy to learn.

20
01:09.740 --> 01:12.180
You also have me as your accountability body.

21
01:12.290 --> 01:16.610
Now that might sound like hogwash but believe you me it is valuable.

22
01:16.610 --> 01:17.510
Ask me anything.

23
01:17.510 --> 01:22.920
Some of your code samples ventured prostrations when you got stuck and you will get stuck and keep in

24
01:22.920 --> 01:28.340
contact because the best way to learn to program is to practice and talk about it.

25
01:28.440 --> 01:30.640
Semi AQ and hey whatever it might be.

26
01:30.650 --> 01:33.040
Get in contact and then return.

27
01:33.080 --> 01:37.790
I asked for only one thing stick out it even if it's just one lecture a day.

28
01:37.790 --> 01:39.410
Stick to it.

29
01:39.560 --> 01:43.320
Politeness is not learned by observing but by doing so.

30
01:43.700 --> 01:46.010
The longest lecture on this course is around 10 minutes.

31
01:46.130 --> 01:50.840
So when you don't feel like programming ask yourself can I spare just 10 minutes.

32
01:50.900 --> 01:53.750
So let's not waste any more time and let's get started.

33
01:53.750 --> 01:56.210
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture. Learn Python 3 For Beginners : Python Programming Tutorial
