Learn Python 3 For Beginners : Python Programming Tutorial - Hi everybody and welcome to this course.

1
00:02.610 --> 00:06.930
First let me thank you for purchasing this course and showing an interest in learning the pipe and tree

2
00:06.960 --> 00:08.490
programming language.

3
00:08.490 --> 00:13.110
In this brief lecture we're just going to outline what you are going to learn throughout the course.

4
00:13.290 --> 00:15.570
So we kick off the course with variables.

5
00:15.570 --> 00:20.640
And in this lecture you learn to store information and variables and work with text and numerical values.

6
00:20.640 --> 00:24.900
Next we're going to look at strings and what are strings but a sequence of characters.

7
00:24.900 --> 00:27.810
And we're going to look at how to use or manipulate them.

8
00:27.810 --> 00:32.310
Following that section we look at numbers so how to compare numbers to see if they're equal are not

9
00:32.310 --> 00:37.890
equal to one another and how to create a list of numbers following that we look at list which are a

10
00:37.890 --> 00:44.130
workhorse of Spuyten and form many of the fundamental parts of your programming list for as much information

11
00:44.160 --> 00:47.590
as you want in one variable allowing you to work with that data efficiently.

12
00:47.640 --> 00:51.860
You'll be able to work with hundreds of thousands and millions of values in just a few lines of code.

13
00:51.870 --> 00:56.510
We then move on to conditions which help you control the flow of your programs.

14
00:56.520 --> 01:01.850
So what happens if user goes one way or another way which are programs what do your programs do.

15
01:01.890 --> 01:03.550
Next we'll look at dictionaries.

16
01:03.660 --> 01:08.310
Dictionaries allow you to connect different pieces of information together like lists.

17
01:08.340 --> 01:11.870
Dictionaries can contain as much information as you need to store them.

18
01:11.870 --> 01:17.250
Look at the user input get gathering input from your users to make your programs more interactive and

19
01:17.250 --> 01:17.820
fun.

20
01:19.050 --> 01:23.150
Next we look at loops which allow your programs to repeat certain blocks of code.

21
01:23.250 --> 01:27.420
Following that you will write functions which are named blocks of code that perform a specific task

22
01:27.450 --> 01:31.080
and can be run whenever you need them and shared with other programmers.

23
01:31.080 --> 01:36.750
In classes we move into object orientated programs classes allow you to model real world objects such

24
01:36.750 --> 01:42.720
as dogs cats people's cars spaceships whatever you want so that your code can represent anything real

25
01:42.720 --> 01:43.950
or abstract.

26
01:43.950 --> 01:45.840
Then we move into working with files.

27
01:45.960 --> 01:49.500
You'll be able to store data so that when your program closes you'll be able to read it back into your

28
01:49.500 --> 01:50.450
programs again.

29
01:50.670 --> 01:55.380
Next we look at how to handle errors and what happens if your programs crash unexpectedly and how to

30
01:55.380 --> 01:56.280
avoid that.

31
01:56.310 --> 02:01.620
Then we look at tests writing tests for your code to help check your programs work the way you intended

32
02:01.620 --> 02:02.120
them to.

33
02:02.250 --> 02:06.690
As a result of this you'll be able to expand your programs without worrying about introducing new errors

34
02:06.720 --> 02:11.850
or bugs testing your code is one of the four skills that will help you transition from beginner to intermediate

35
02:11.850 --> 02:12.720
programmer.

36
02:13.010 --> 02:15.960
They are the main topics covered in this course.

37
02:15.960 --> 02:19.330
Thanks for listening and let's get started with setting you up with Spuyten.

38
02:19.350 --> 02:20.530
I'll see you in the next lecture. Learn Python 3 For Beginners : Python Programming Tutorial
