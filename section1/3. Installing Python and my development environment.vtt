Hi everybody and welcome this short lecture we're going to briefly discuss how to install piking on

00:05.770 --> 00:08.720
both Windows and Mac OS X.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.520
So I'm using a Mac.

00:10.570 --> 00:15.030
So what you do is you go to pite and dot org WW dot dot org.

00:15.130 --> 00:18.310
Here you are here and then you click downloads.

00:18.470 --> 00:23.740
So as you can see on the downloads it's identified that I'm on a Mac and I can select an three point

00:23.740 --> 00:25.150
five point two.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.860
Now don't worry if that number is higher than what you see here because it may have moved on.

00:28.860 --> 00:33.460
By the time you purchased this course once you click pite entry point five point two the download will

00:33.460 --> 00:33.940
begin.

00:33.940 --> 00:36.420
And you can then install it on your application.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.280
And the same works for Windows.

00:38.350 --> 00:41.140
You download it and then you install it on your application.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.080
So once you have download it you can check if it's installed by doing the following.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.930
Go to your term not so in Mac.

00:46.930 --> 00:50.740
I got my launchpad and I type in terminal.

00:50.830 --> 00:51.670
There it is there.

00:54.260 --> 00:58.660
And I can type in my terminal piping tree.

00:58.700 --> 00:59.100
There you go.

00:59.100 --> 01:03.470
Now you can see my piping tray is installed and working.

01:03.710 --> 01:06.860
And you can also use this now as a quick adsorbed empire.

01:06.860 --> 01:14.820
And so one plus one to go a quick Spuyten and the it works the same on Windows.

01:14.870 --> 01:19.580
When you're in your terminal and windows you type in Python and I think it might be HIF and v for version

01:19.580 --> 01:22.780
so Pinetree hyphen VI but you might want to check that.

01:23.090 --> 01:27.600
Now when you have downloaded in one of the things that it gives you is the IDL e.

01:27.620 --> 01:31.180
Or as I call it the idle interactive development environment.

01:31.220 --> 01:36.580
So let's just go into that so I can go to my launch pad and you can see Idol here is the same on Windows.

01:36.590 --> 01:41.000
It will be installed as an application and you can click on it to run it or search for it and then run

01:41.000 --> 01:41.600
it.

01:41.600 --> 01:47.590
So here we have it here Idol and again this is an interactive development environment which means it

01:47.590 --> 01:55.000
gives you instant feedback to one plus one to print built in function print let you know exactly what

01:55.000 --> 01:55.260
it is.

01:55.270 --> 02:00.770
It's a built in Python function so that's installed and running away.

02:00.880 --> 02:07.090
Now you can use idle for a lot of programs rotis course and the way to build an even bigger program

02:07.210 --> 02:08.250
is what idle say.

02:08.250 --> 02:15.620
File new file and you get a working file here and you can begin to write your code save it and run it.

02:15.690 --> 02:19.850
And the way you run it is you go file and run Mudgal.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.680
But we explained that further on in the lecture.

02:23.710 --> 02:30.050
Now in the lecture you'll see me jump and be true idle my code editor of choice which is subline And

02:30.100 --> 02:35.320
here's my sublime interface here so you can see I've got actually two programs open from the Course

02:35.860 --> 02:36.430
now troat.

02:36.430 --> 02:40.940
Of course you'll see me jump from sublime into Idol and from Idol into subline.

02:40.960 --> 02:41.910
And why is that.

02:42.100 --> 02:47.670
Well sublime is a great text editor but what it doesn't do is it doesn't allow you to enter user input.

02:47.890 --> 02:52.150
So a lot of our programs are going to ask the user to input such things as their name or address the

02:52.150 --> 02:54.050
phone number whatever it might be.

02:54.070 --> 02:57.070
You cannot do that in sublime but you can do it in I'd.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.710
So I jump back and forth between sublime and idle.

02:59.800 --> 03:04.800
But I do recommend subline because it's a very quick very easy install of an ID.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.280
So that's my set up environment.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.370
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
