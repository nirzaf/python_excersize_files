Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.770 --> 00:06.940
Now we're moving into a new section now so we're moving away from lists and we're moving into dictionaries.

00:07.110 --> 00:09.880
So in this section we're going to look at writing dictionaries.

00:10.230 --> 00:14.390
So pite and dictionaries allow you to collect pieces of related information.

00:14.490 --> 00:19.580
So in that sense they are exactly like real war dictionaries where you have words connected to the meanings.

00:19.610 --> 00:22.320
So let's take a look at a very simple example.

00:22.380 --> 00:23.680
So here we have our file.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.090
So as always we start off with some comments.

00:26.130 --> 00:29.080
Now how do we create a dictionary.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.260
We're going to call this dictionary book one.

00:32.220 --> 00:36.140
And then the dictionary is created with curly brackets.

00:36.180 --> 00:38.830
So the first thing we do is we enter in a key.

00:38.910 --> 00:40.440
It's what's called a key.

00:40.650 --> 00:42.700
And we're going to call this key alter.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.960
So take again back to a real world example in a dictionary.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.310
You have the word.

00:47.430 --> 00:52.890
So it is when we have order which isn't Pioneer's known as the key and we are going to sign the key

00:52.960 --> 00:54.510
the value.

00:54.520 --> 01:00.470
Tony Stanton so in the real world dictionary we would lock up Oerter and we would see Tony Staunton's

01:00.630 --> 01:04.040
think of it like that way it helps to think of it as a real world dictionary.

01:04.350 --> 01:10.170
Now we're going to add in one more value and keys and our values are separated by a comma much like

01:10.170 --> 01:10.810
a list.

01:11.010 --> 01:17.610
So this key is going to be price going to assign price the value of 10.

01:17.640 --> 01:21.880
And because this is an integer we don't need to surround it with quotes.

01:21.920 --> 01:27.180
Now print and we're going to be printing from a dictionary which is called Book 1.

01:27.470 --> 01:31.100
And what we want to do is we want to get the order from our dictionary.

01:31.190 --> 01:34.740
And the key to that is water.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.800
And that will give us back to value.

01:36.800 --> 01:43.230
Tony Stanton next we want to print again from a dictionary.

01:43.230 --> 01:43.770
Book one

01:47.920 --> 01:51.870
we want to print out the price value.

01:51.990 --> 01:54.690
Now we know the price is 10.

01:55.650 --> 01:57.800
OK let's run it.

02:00.130 --> 02:01.210
There we go.

02:01.210 --> 02:07.690
Tony Stanton is the author and the price of this book is 10 so let's just have a quick look again.

02:07.790 --> 02:10.510
We started by naming our dictionary book one.

02:10.550 --> 02:17.870
We then started with opening curly brackets the first key in a dictionary is order order is run by single

02:17.870 --> 02:18.530
quotes.

02:18.530 --> 02:21.530
We don't have a colon followed by the key value.

02:21.530 --> 02:26.120
So author is the key and after the colon is the key value.

02:26.150 --> 02:31.910
Tony Stanton so author and Tony standing next to a comma we have price.

02:31.910 --> 02:36.220
FLATOW next key price and the value of price is 10.

02:36.340 --> 02:41.570
So keys and the values are separated by a colon on the dictionary book 1 stores the books order and

02:41.570 --> 02:45.780
price are to print statements access and display that information.

02:45.860 --> 02:49.670
The next lecture we're gonna have a look at exactly what goes on inside a dictionary.

02:49.780 --> 02:51.180
But this is a good example.

02:51.280 --> 02:55.210
So I hope you enjoyed it and if any questions please do not hesitate to contact me and I'll see you

02:55.210 --> 02:55.960
in the next lecture.
