Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.710 --> 00:07.110
Now the last lecture we had a very quick introduction into pite and dictionaries the topic of this section

00:07.630 --> 00:11.510
but in this lecture we're going to look at exactly what's going on inside a dictionary.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.880
So as we know in a dictionary is a collection of key value pairs.

00:15.900 --> 00:21.920
Each key is connected to a value and I can use a key to access the value associated with that key a

00:22.070 --> 00:26.010
key value can be a number a string a list or even an order dictionary.

00:26.220 --> 00:31.530
You can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary dictionary are wrapped

00:31.620 --> 00:34.770
in curly brackets with a series of key value pairs inside them.

00:34.770 --> 00:38.410
So as we saw in our last lecture we created a dictionary called Book 1.

00:38.570 --> 00:39.780
So let's just do that again.

00:39.780 --> 00:49.120
Book 1 equals nine curly brackets and now we have a first key which we called Oerter.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.980
And as you can see that is wrapped in single quotes.

00:52.290 --> 00:59.130
Each key is separated by a colon and the value that we want to assign to this key is Tony and the author's

00:59.130 --> 00:59.940
name.

00:59.940 --> 01:03.870
I wish I'd written a book and let's just close out of a key value pair.

01:03.870 --> 01:07.020
It is a set of values associated with each other.

01:07.210 --> 01:11.800
When you provide a key pipefitters the value associated with that key we showed up in the last letter

01:11.800 --> 01:17.200
where we asked to print the order and we got totally stoned and in return every key is connected to

01:17.200 --> 01:21.610
its value by a colon an individual key value pairs are separated by commas.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.660
So let's add in and note a key value pair comma.

01:25.050 --> 01:26.110
Let's call this from price

01:29.100 --> 01:32.450
and that's assigned to value 10.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.920
You can store as many key value pairs as you want in a dictionary.

01:35.940 --> 01:38.700
The simplest dictionary has only one key value pair.

01:38.760 --> 01:43.170
If you're anything like me then right now you're wondering what's the difference between lists or tuple

01:43.470 --> 01:44.940
and dictionaries.

01:44.940 --> 01:45.680
What dictionary.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.880
You don't store information in a sequence.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.130
Instead you store it in pairs.

01:50.130 --> 01:55.500
And as I said previously piping dictionaries are a lot like real world dictionaries in a real dictionary.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.200
Each entry is a pair a word and it's definition.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.920
When you look up a word you get a definition.

02:00.960 --> 02:05.700
So I hope that explains pite and dictionaries and a little bit more detail for you and a key value pairs

02:05.760 --> 02:08.410
and how dictionaries are created and the next lecture.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.920
We're going to be creating dictionaries and then retrieving values from them.

02:12.270 --> 02:14.000
Thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
