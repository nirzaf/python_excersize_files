Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.680 --> 00:05.190
Now this lecture we're going to look at another way to retrieve a value from a dictionary.

00:05.370 --> 00:07.810
And that is using pipings get method.

00:07.830 --> 00:12.630
Now the good thing about this method is that it has a built in safety net for handling situations where

00:12.630 --> 00:15.040
you ask for a value of a key that doesn't exist.

00:15.270 --> 00:19.530
If the key doesn't exist the method returns a default value which you can define.

00:19.530 --> 00:20.190
So let's have a look.

00:20.190 --> 00:29.370
So let's first create or dictionary terms equals and let's give it our first key which is integer and

00:29.370 --> 00:35.120
let's get this integer the value a whole number because that's what an integer is.

00:35.310 --> 00:44.040
OK now let's print this out using our GET method print terms that guess and we're using does get notation

00:44.310 --> 00:47.530
because we want this method to act upon the terms dictionary.

00:47.550 --> 00:50.480
That's why its terms don't get.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.990
And we want to print integer.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.600
OK let's have a look.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.780
There we go a whole number.

00:57.790 --> 01:01.330
Now what happens if we try an access key that is not in the dictionary.

01:01.450 --> 01:07.180
Well let's give it a go print terms.

01:07.320 --> 01:09.280
Get.

01:09.540 --> 01:20.130
Let's say float like our last example and now we add in a comma not in the dictionary.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.400
OK and let's see what we get.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.140
Now let's correct a quick typo.

01:24.140 --> 01:24.860
There we go.

01:24.860 --> 01:26.360
Let's see.

01:26.360 --> 01:27.350
There we go.

01:27.350 --> 01:28.720
Not in the dictionary.

01:28.760 --> 01:32.790
By using the get method we are guaranteed to get a value back in this example.

01:32.810 --> 01:36.370
If the key float wasn't a dictionary we would have gotten that value back.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.230
But as it was not we instead got our default message.

01:39.380 --> 01:42.230
If you don't supply a default message you don't get anything back.

01:43.010 --> 01:46.630
OK so I hope that explained another way to retrieve the value from a dictionary.

01:46.670 --> 01:49.900
And as always if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.730
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
