Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.500 --> 00:06.800
Now this lecture we're going to look at how to edit and how to delete values in a dictionary.

00:06.970 --> 00:11.740
So as you can see I've started off with some comments and the name of this program anything the leading

00:11.800 --> 00:13.230
values in a dictionary.

00:13.630 --> 00:18.820
So I've pretty written our dictionary here which is called terms equals integer.

00:18.940 --> 00:21.680
And then as you can see here the value is not quite correct.

00:21.700 --> 00:25.570
We've given our key integer a value is a number that contains a decimal place.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.650
But as we know that is not an integer.

00:27.670 --> 00:28.750
That's actually a float.

00:28.750 --> 00:31.990
So what we're going to do here now is we are going to edit this.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.070
And how do we do that.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.740
Well first let's print this out to make sure it's right.

00:35.750 --> 00:44.490
Print terms that get integer.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.850
So let's make sure what we have prints out.

00:47.160 --> 00:47.670
There we go.

00:47.670 --> 00:49.460
It's a number that contains a decimal place.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.390
So that's wrong.

00:50.600 --> 00:55.730
So what we need to do is just add an end of the line here to edit the value in a dictionary.

00:55.740 --> 01:01.560
You give the name of the dictionary which is terms along with the key in square brackets and then the

01:01.560 --> 01:04.470
new value you want to assign to the key.

01:04.470 --> 01:13.200
So we have terms and we are going to added our integer key or we are going to assign this is the correct

01:13.200 --> 01:16.970
definition of an integer a whole number.

01:17.210 --> 01:17.910
OK.

01:18.950 --> 01:21.630
So let's run this now and see what we get.

01:21.640 --> 01:27.450
There we go our integer k has been overwritten with a new k a whole number.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.170
OK so that seems simple enough.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.610
What about removing key value pairs from a dictionary.

01:31.780 --> 01:33.740
OK let's have a look at how we do that.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.760
Let's add in a new key value pair.

01:37.390 --> 01:39.940
So come on let's add in a string

01:44.510 --> 01:50.660
that's given its value a sequence of characters.

01:50.660 --> 01:51.330
There we go.

01:51.380 --> 01:52.490
Perfect.

01:52.520 --> 01:56.540
Now that's print caroms

01:59.130 --> 02:02.990
integer is a number that contains a decimal place string sequence of characters.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.730
OK let's just remove this line for a moment.

02:07.630 --> 02:10.060
And let's see about the leading integer.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.780
Well we don't want a piece of information that say it in a dictionary.

02:12.840 --> 02:18.460
We can use the delete statement to completely remove the key value pair to use a delete statement.

02:18.480 --> 02:23.070
We need to only supplied with the name of the dictionary and the key we want to remove so our name of

02:23.070 --> 02:24.090
the dictionary is.

02:24.080 --> 02:31.660
Well first we get the delete statement is the name for a dictionary and we want to remove integer.

02:32.270 --> 02:38.110
And now we want to print terms and hopefully we only get one key value pair here.

02:38.170 --> 02:42.180
Of string and its value and there we go.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.750
Perfect.

02:43.890 --> 02:48.020
So I hope this helped to show you how to edit and remove key value pairs from the dictionary.

02:48.020 --> 02:51.010
If not please don't hesitate to ask me a question in the Q&amp;A section.

02:51.230 --> 02:53.840
And as always thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
