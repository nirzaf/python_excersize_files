00:00.990 --> 00:02.750
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.750 --> 00:06.010
In a previous lecture we had a program working out our birthday month.

00:06.260 --> 00:07.430
Let's revisit that now.

00:07.460 --> 00:10.280
Only this time let's use dictionaries to do it.

00:10.550 --> 00:12.480
So let's create a dictionary.

00:12.830 --> 00:16.790
Very thing months equals.

00:16.850 --> 00:21.930
I'm going to make this Lebert easier to read by separating out a key value pairs on the individual lines.

00:21.980 --> 00:30.260
So Tony and that's given it the value November I should say give me the value of November.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.420
It doesn't sound very good.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.320
Make and aligned with a comma and then a new line.

00:35.390 --> 00:38.690
Let's go Pat let's give him June

00:41.650 --> 00:49.720
comma and their line and then let's go Mary quote Don't forget the single quotes Tony.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.350
Mary and let's give her May.

00:52.580 --> 00:53.760
So there we go.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.450
And again you can close this line here with a comma.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.980
So this dictionary is now broken out over several lines which I think makes it easier to read.

01:00.980 --> 01:03.160
Just remember to end your lines with a comma.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.880
So just for clarity and just make sure everything works let's print this out.

01:06.950 --> 01:10.660
Print birthday months.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.150
There we go.

01:11.150 --> 01:14.010
Tony November marry May June.

01:14.090 --> 01:18.130
Each case a person's name and each value is separate a month.

01:18.230 --> 01:21.150
So let's now see how we can loop through this dictionary.

01:21.350 --> 01:26.180
So as we discussed before your pardon programs can be used to store not just a few pieces of information

01:26.360 --> 01:28.360
but thousands and millions.

01:28.490 --> 01:32.420
When your dictionary start to reach a certain size you're going to want the ability to loop through

01:32.420 --> 01:33.170
them.

01:33.170 --> 01:38.750
You have the ability to look to your dictionaries in several ways you can loop true key value pairs

01:39.320 --> 01:42.490
you can loop through its keys or you can loop through its values.

01:42.530 --> 01:45.260
Let's start looping through key value Paris.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.190
Now let's create a new dictionary.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.720
Let's first get this a comet looping through

01:53.350 --> 01:58.150
key value pairs so we know what this one is doing.

01:58.420 --> 02:02.140
Now a new dictionary is called Book one that's called name

02:08.660 --> 02:10.590
Elon Musk.

02:10.820 --> 02:11.880
I've used this book before.

02:11.870 --> 02:15.290
So you think I only have the one book but I have a few but I just happen to like this book and it's

02:15.290 --> 02:18.300
on my desk as we are talking right now.

02:18.410 --> 02:25.070
Orser is Ashley SAGAL The Vance VAMC comment.

02:25.070 --> 02:27.400
Don't forget your comma at the end of your line.

02:27.510 --> 02:28.070
Price

02:32.330 --> 02:40.940
one four point nine nine and we don't need to surround that in quotes and publisher and don't forget

02:41.360 --> 02:47.790
your quote here because we do need to surround it in quotes Virgin Books

02:51.280 --> 02:51.790
OK.

02:51.830 --> 02:52.560
There we go.

02:52.850 --> 02:55.110
Let's just print this out make sure it's working.

02:55.130 --> 03:01.320
Print the O book one.

03:01.320 --> 03:02.390
There we go.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.500
Publisher of Virgin Books.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.290
Name and Address.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.910
Now do we have a dictionary created.

03:07.160 --> 03:12.590
Let's create a for loop and in a for loop we create the names of two variables that will hold the key

03:12.680 --> 03:13.620
and the value.

03:13.700 --> 03:20.750
So we have four and then the names of the two variables key and value add these two variables will hold

03:20.750 --> 03:23.320
the key and the value in each key value pair.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.670
We can choose any names you want for these two variables.

03:25.670 --> 03:28.170
Our program will run just as well as we call them.

03:28.190 --> 03:35.880
X and y so key and value in book 1 that items

03:38.600 --> 03:42.830
and color print and apprentice on a new line

03:45.380 --> 03:50.830
backslash and key plus key.

03:50.910 --> 03:52.720
So all this should look very familiar.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.000
Print value

03:58.710 --> 03:59.760
plus value

04:02.460 --> 04:07.590
OK now and as part of a statement we include the name of the dictionary followed by the method item

04:08.510 --> 04:11.160
This returns a list of key value pairs.

04:11.380 --> 04:12.570
The for loop then stores.

04:12.580 --> 04:18.100
Each of these pairs into two variables provided we don't use the variables to print each key followed

04:18.100 --> 04:18.840
by its value.

04:18.850 --> 04:20.540
So let's see how this looks.

04:20.980 --> 04:21.550
And there we go.

04:21.550 --> 04:22.060
Very nice.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.150
Nice and clean.

04:23.170 --> 04:30.330
So publisher Vergine book's author Ashley Vance name Elon Musk and then the price when we run this program.

04:30.330 --> 04:34.540
You'll notice that the key value pairs are not returned in the order in which they start in which they

04:34.540 --> 04:35.530
were stored.

04:35.530 --> 04:40.120
This is because it doesn't care about the order in which key value pairs are stored.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.520
Looping through all key value pairs works particularly well for dictionaries.

04:43.600 --> 04:48.760
Like our birthday months which stores the same kind of information for many different keys.

04:48.930 --> 04:53.460
If we look to the month's dictionary we get the name of each person in the dictionary on their birthday

04:53.460 --> 04:54.020
months.

04:54.060 --> 05:00.690
So let's do that now let's get at this let's remove the print birthday months line and let's go for

05:01.270 --> 05:03.380
key value.

05:03.390 --> 05:06.410
And as we set these variables can be anything but we leave them as they are.

05:10.940 --> 05:21.760
In birthday month items print now more we're going to do here is we're just going to change just fractionally.

05:21.890 --> 05:25.460
So we're going to say in print and again we're going to give it a new line.

05:25.460 --> 05:28.820
So we're going to say print them we're going to say name

05:34.190 --> 05:38.400
ke I'll go print it again.

05:39.820 --> 05:40.790
I'm going to say money

05:46.030 --> 05:47.970
jumped the line there by mistake.

05:48.210 --> 05:51.250
I'm going to say plus value.

05:51.390 --> 05:54.240
Now let's run this and see what we get.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.000
There we go.

05:55.820 --> 05:59.040
Past June Tony November.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.150
Mary.

06:00.370 --> 06:01.210
Very nice.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.690
So as you can see they're looping through a dictionary.

06:03.700 --> 06:07.450
It's very simple and the open format is very nice and very clean.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.350
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
