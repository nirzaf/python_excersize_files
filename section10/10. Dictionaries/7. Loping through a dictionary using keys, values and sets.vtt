Hi everybody and welcome back down to a previous lecture we saw how to loop through the Keys and value

00:05.190 --> 00:10.410
pairs of a dictionary and this lecture we're going to look at some other ways to look to a dictionary.

00:10.410 --> 00:16.140
Let's start off by looping through the keys of a dictionary using the keys method.

00:16.170 --> 00:20.250
This method is useful when you don't need to use all of the values in a dictionary.

00:20.490 --> 00:21.570
So let's have a look.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.770
First let's create a dictionary.

00:24.150 --> 00:28.590
And as you can see here I've just copied and pasted our birthday months dictionary from the previous

00:28.680 --> 00:36.960
lecture and what I'm going to do now is out in a for loop for name in birthday months.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.020
That is and we want the keys because this is the key method.

00:44.790 --> 00:49.700
Print name title

00:53.130 --> 00:54.450
and let's see what we get there.

00:57.730 --> 01:01.150
Tony Pat Mary very very nice.

01:01.150 --> 01:06.280
Now if you want to loop true the values in a dictionary you can use the values method and let's have

01:06.280 --> 01:11.650
a look at us for months and birthday months.

01:13.140 --> 01:13.820
Five use

01:18.050 --> 01:27.550
we always remember your code and print months thought title that's run out.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.770
There we go.

01:29.140 --> 01:30.330
June November may.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.300
Excellent.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.530
Using this method pite impose all the values from a dictionary without checking for repeats.

01:35.590 --> 01:39.860
If you had a dictionary with a massive amount of information this way it would not be very practical

01:40.340 --> 01:41.920
if you were a dictionary without I.

01:41.950 --> 01:48.360
We can use what's called a set a set is similar to a list except that each item in the set must be unique.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.810
And how do we create a set.

01:49.850 --> 01:55.210
Well let's have a look for when we just need to own and then that.

01:55.240 --> 02:02.350
That's a word for months in set and the months that values

02:05.920 --> 02:10.580
cola print months

02:13.490 --> 02:16.530
thought title and what we get.

02:16.530 --> 02:20.380
Now we have a set June May November.

02:20.410 --> 02:26.290
OK so that's printed out our June main November but what happens if we edit our dictionary.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.620
The set up Mary birthday is in June.

02:29.620 --> 02:30.520
Let's run it now.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.990
Actually let's just clear away the space so it's bit more legible.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.170
Let's run our program again.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.450
There we go.

02:39.490 --> 02:42.990
So as you can see at the bottom June is only mentioned once.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.040
So every value in a set must be unique.

02:47.170 --> 02:51.610
So June although it's mentioned twice in a dictionary is shown only once.

02:51.610 --> 02:52.880
Ok I hope that helps.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.740
And as always if you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out and ask me.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.660
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
