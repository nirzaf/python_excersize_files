00:01.920 --> 00:03.400
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:03.420 --> 00:08.280
Now we looked previously at a Book Dictionary which contained a variety of information about one book

00:08.790 --> 00:13.230
but it had no room to store information about a second book and let alone what would happen if we had

00:13.230 --> 00:18.960
a torrid and for book or one way to tackle this problem is to make a list of books in which each book

00:18.960 --> 00:21.430
is a dictionary of information about that book.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.860
So let's take a look.

00:22.890 --> 00:27.170
I'm going to pause this letter now and just create three dictionaries of books information.

00:27.210 --> 00:28.960
So back to you now in just a moment.

00:29.210 --> 00:29.710
Hey everybody.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.570
So here we go.

00:30.690 --> 00:33.540
And you can see my book details.

00:33.770 --> 00:36.190
So I've created book Zero book one book too.

00:36.420 --> 00:37.590
So I have name.

00:37.810 --> 00:44.040
I have book name I have author I have the price and I have the publisher.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.780
So some solid book details in there.

00:46.800 --> 00:52.240
Now what we need to do is we need to take each of these books dictionaries and add them to a list.

00:52.340 --> 00:55.240
So let's collarless books because that's exactly what it is.

00:55.350 --> 01:05.400
Let's create a list with square brackets and we have book Zero color book one color book to come up.

01:05.820 --> 01:07.920
And so I know because at the end of our list.

01:07.950 --> 01:08.510
OK.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.590
So we have dictionaries and we have a list.

01:10.620 --> 01:16.760
Now we're going to create a for loop for book and books.

01:16.760 --> 01:24.770
OK so for each book and books print book OK.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.040
Now what does that get us.

01:26.150 --> 01:27.230
Well let's have a look.

01:28.220 --> 01:28.820
There we go.

01:29.990 --> 01:35.510
It puts in admittedly not exactly user friendly format but still it outputs all the information from

01:35.540 --> 01:37.630
each dictionary.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.930
Let's look at another example and go back to our stationery store program.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.560
Let's create a new empty list for storing stock items.

01:44.570 --> 01:45.950
Ok so I've just created a new file.

01:45.950 --> 01:48.640
And as you can see I have added some comments at the top.

01:48.770 --> 01:58.220
So the first thing you want to do is create an empty list so stock items or stock items equals and there

01:58.220 --> 01:59.480
we go an empty list.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.190
OK.

02:00.290 --> 02:03.650
Now what we want to do is you want to create some stock items.

02:03.650 --> 02:08.780
So let's create 50 pens all of the same type of blue ballpoint one ninety nine.

02:08.810 --> 02:10.330
So let's go ahead and do that.

02:10.430 --> 02:14.390
So let's add in a comment because this is something that we haven't really done before although we have

02:14.390 --> 02:17.460
seen it so make 50 blue pants.

02:17.510 --> 02:18.170
OK.

02:18.560 --> 02:28.190
So for blue pants in range we've seen the range function before.

02:28.250 --> 02:34.940
So we're going to go 0 to 50 and that's going to create 50 instances of blue pant colon.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.710
And what we're going to say is a new blue pen

02:39.890 --> 02:42.050
equals.

02:42.190 --> 02:44.080
Now here we go we're creating a dictionary.

02:44.080 --> 02:50.260
So we get color I'll leave it to you for my American friends blue

02:54.050 --> 02:55.160
color type

02:59.030 --> 02:59.490
ballpoint

03:05.900 --> 03:08.000
comma and then price

03:11.270 --> 03:14.950
colon one point nine nine.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.410
There we go OK.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.790
Next for stock items.

03:19.790 --> 03:22.680
So for a list stock items.

03:22.820 --> 03:28.750
So a catch or two new blue pen OK.

03:28.980 --> 03:30.160
Let's see what that does.

03:30.180 --> 03:32.670
That's just a little curiosity experiment.

03:32.760 --> 03:41.310
Let's just print out blue pen print let's print up stock items print stock items and let's see what

03:41.310 --> 03:42.280
that gives us.

03:44.590 --> 03:45.410
There we go.

03:45.720 --> 03:51.120
Fifty Bluepoint Pence all price at 199th.

03:51.340 --> 03:51.660
OK.

03:51.700 --> 03:52.290
Not bad.

03:52.310 --> 03:58.030
So let's remove our print statement there because we don't need it now pipe and considers each of these

03:58.120 --> 03:59.480
a separate object.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.360
This allows us to modify each pen individually.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.570
And why might you ask.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.760
We want to change each pan individually.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.890
Well what happens when we sell one.

04:07.930 --> 04:13.660
Obviously we have to reduce our list by one or if we run a sale and we want to reduce the price of only

04:13.720 --> 04:18.930
half our stock to change Japan's price we can use a for loop and an IF statement.

04:19.510 --> 04:24.560
Let's change the price of the first five pounds from one 99 to 99 Cent.

04:24.580 --> 04:27.600
So let's as we say that's out in the comment here.

04:31.820 --> 04:39.480
Changing the price of the first five pence.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.630
OK.

04:41.150 --> 04:46.130
So for blue and in-stock items.

04:46.340 --> 04:51.200
So for blue pens in stock items we take the first five call.

04:51.530 --> 04:57.070
So if these first five blue pens so blue pen is priced as

05:02.370 --> 05:03.390
1 9 9

05:06.270 --> 05:07.680
then make its price.

05:07.880 --> 05:08.500
Blue Pen

05:12.370 --> 05:17.750
make its price zero point nine nine.

05:18.140 --> 05:18.760
OK.

05:21.060 --> 05:25.170
Now what we want to do is we want to print out those four five blue pants.

05:25.170 --> 05:40.670
So for blue pen and stock items zero to fives we're only working with the first five again print blue

05:40.990 --> 05:41.610
pen.

05:42.000 --> 05:42.370
OK.

05:42.380 --> 05:43.520
Let's see if that works.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.440
Perfect.

05:46.460 --> 05:47.910
So we have our colors the same.

05:47.940 --> 05:51.270
Our prices got 0.9 9 and a type as ballpoint.

05:51.280 --> 05:56.420
So as you will see it's common to store a number of dictionaries in a list with each dictionary containing

05:56.600 --> 06:02.630
many kinds of information about one object you might create a dictionary for each user of a website

06:02.840 --> 06:05.780
and then store individual dictionaries in a list called user.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.290
So you might create a dictionary of user attributes.

06:08.300 --> 06:15.110
What we've done here is these two examples we've created a dictionary of books Sortiment a list and

06:15.110 --> 06:17.990
then we've seen how to change an item in a dictionary.

06:17.990 --> 06:19.170
Hokus has been helpful.

06:19.250 --> 06:23.060
And as always if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me and I'll see you in the

06:23.060 --> 06:23.670
next lecture.

06:23.750 --> 06:24.270
Thank you.
