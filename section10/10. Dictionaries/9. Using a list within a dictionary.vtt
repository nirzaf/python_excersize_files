00:00.720 --> 00:02.700
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.700 --> 00:07.530
Now we've just seen how to put a dictionary or a set of dictionaries in a list something that is called

00:07.620 --> 00:08.850
nesting.

00:08.850 --> 00:12.330
Now let's take a look at putting a list inside a dictionary.

00:12.330 --> 00:15.060
Let's take purchasing a new car as our example.

00:15.270 --> 00:20.150
If we were to just use a list all we would have a list is a list of the cars features.

00:20.250 --> 00:24.100
So alloy wheels side airbags whatever it might be.

00:24.100 --> 00:30.150
We would just have a list of the car's features but by storing a list in a dictionary the list of features

00:30.150 --> 00:35.670
can be just one aspect of the car we are purchasing so we could have a dictionary that defines the type

00:35.670 --> 00:39.430
of car we can have a dictionary defines the type of features and so on.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.340
In this example we have a car with two kinds of information.

00:42.630 --> 00:48.810
The standard car features which come with any car purchase and a list of additional actors which any

00:48.810 --> 00:55.970
consumer can ask for the list of actors is a value associated with the key extras to use the items in

00:55.970 --> 00:56.660
a list.

00:56.760 --> 01:02.340
We give the name of the dictionary and the key extras as reward and value in the dictionary instead

01:02.340 --> 01:03.650
of returning a single value.

01:03.690 --> 01:05.980
We get a list of the cars extras.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.050
So let's see how we can do that now.

01:08.310 --> 01:12.120
We kick off by creating a dictionary that holds info about the car we ordered.

01:12.180 --> 01:20.510
So let's do that car and let's change that to my forward car.

01:20.650 --> 01:21.710
Equals.

01:22.210 --> 01:23.240
OK.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.460
Let's do a new line so it's nice and clean type.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.040
So what kind of car did you order.

01:28.390 --> 01:34.680
Well let's just keep it nice and simple you order the standard four door saloon.

01:35.510 --> 01:36.120
OK.

01:37.900 --> 01:42.530
Now the next key We're going to add is extras.

01:42.640 --> 01:49.570
So have you any have you ordered any extras which are car this is going to be a list of any additional

01:49.570 --> 01:51.400
extras that you requested.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.030
So let's see that's Krater list with square brackets.

01:54.130 --> 01:55.040
And what did you ask for.

01:55.060 --> 01:55.690
Well you asked for.

01:55.690 --> 01:56.450
Alloy wheels

01:59.340 --> 02:02.320
you ask for climate control.

02:02.460 --> 02:07.910
Don't forget your single quotes because this is just a normal list control.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.180
Anything else when you ask for the letter.

02:12.180 --> 02:13.350
Heated seats.

02:13.350 --> 02:16.530
So again I just forgot the opening single quote the letter.

02:16.530 --> 02:17.930
Heated seats.

02:18.190 --> 02:19.590
OK let's leave it at that.

02:19.590 --> 02:20.620
There we go.

02:20.940 --> 02:21.710
There's a list.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.290
Create.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.460
Let's now print an order of our summary

02:31.080 --> 02:31.480
print

02:34.590 --> 02:42.240
the car you ordered is a closer quote.

02:42.310 --> 02:53.550
Plus car plus type so we're accessing our dictionary and we're accessing the key type from that dictionary.

02:55.360 --> 02:55.810
Plus

02:58.980 --> 03:05.120
and actually just put in a space there with the following extras.

03:07.030 --> 03:07.610
OK.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.960
So let's see what we do now.

03:09.250 --> 03:14.130
Well we want to tour extras for extra incar.

03:14.630 --> 03:22.370
So for any extra in a car dictionary we want to access all our extras.

03:23.380 --> 03:29.070
Key So we want to access the value of an extra key and we want to print these out.

03:29.100 --> 03:29.490
Print

03:32.960 --> 03:34.020
backslash.

03:34.070 --> 03:41.600
And here's something we haven't used before although we have seen it tab plus extra OK.

03:41.620 --> 03:44.320
So let's run this now and see what we get.

03:44.350 --> 03:44.830
Error.

03:44.980 --> 03:45.300
Error.

03:45.310 --> 03:47.080
OK so where's our error.

03:47.530 --> 03:49.720
Well it's telling us it's at line 7.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.360
So let's have a look at line 7.

03:51.580 --> 03:52.620
And here we go.

03:52.630 --> 03:54.290
I forgot my colon.

03:54.580 --> 03:55.100
OK.

03:55.150 --> 03:55.630
There we go.

03:55.630 --> 03:56.120
Correct.

03:56.140 --> 03:57.550
Let's run it again.

03:57.820 --> 03:58.530
Another error.

03:58.630 --> 03:59.350
This is not good.

03:59.350 --> 04:00.890
Let's have a look.

04:00.910 --> 04:07.150
So the error is telling me it's on line 12 and it's telling me car is not defined.

04:07.170 --> 04:13.190
And rightly so because we don't have a dictionary called car we have a dictionary called my ordered

04:13.720 --> 04:14.440
car.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.450
There we go on again.

04:17.490 --> 04:26.810
We have it here in car but it's not car it's my ordered car removed an additional car.

04:26.820 --> 04:33.700
Let's say you hate the car you ordered is a standard Ford or saloon with the following extras alloy

04:33.700 --> 04:34.100
wheels.

04:34.110 --> 04:35.410
Climate control letter.

04:35.410 --> 04:36.510
Heated seats.

04:36.600 --> 04:41.550
So as we just don't we have nested list inside the dictionary whenever you want more than one value

04:41.550 --> 04:43.740
to be associated with a single dictionary.

04:43.740 --> 04:46.220
You can use lists within that dictionary.

04:46.230 --> 04:48.690
Very very helpful resource.

04:48.690 --> 04:49.070
OK.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.040
Thank you for listening.

04:50.130 --> 04:52.170
And that brings us to the end of our section on dictionaries.

04:52.190 --> 04:56.130
But if you have any questions at all please do not hesitate to contact me and I'll see you in the next

04:56.130 --> 04:56.640
lecture.

04:56.640 --> 04:57.160
Thank you.
