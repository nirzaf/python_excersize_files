Hi everybody welcome back.

00:01.900 --> 00:05.930
Now we previously looked at getting info from our users using the input.

00:06.050 --> 00:09.920
Now we're going to be doing something similar again in this lecture which is why as you can see I've

00:09.920 --> 00:15.950
moved from my Sublime Text Editor into my idol text and so now that our programs are becoming more advanced

00:16.250 --> 00:18.760
and longer it's time to revisit the input prompts.

00:18.920 --> 00:23.040
Sometimes you want to write a longer prompt than simply What's your name.

00:23.360 --> 00:27.680
You can store your prompt in a variable and pass that variable to the input function.

00:27.680 --> 00:32.990
This way you can write your prompts over several lines then write a nice clean import statement.

00:33.170 --> 00:35.420
Let's take a look at how we will do that.

00:35.420 --> 00:36.030
So prompt

00:40.050 --> 00:40.980
eaglet.

00:41.060 --> 00:46.840
So I just paused this video for a second and I've entered in Alwi you can see is a very long front.

00:46.910 --> 00:51.680
This is our lecturer discussing pipings in plant and how to keep a tidy please and your favorite so

00:51.680 --> 00:53.070
far and why you like it.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.990
This is a double space there and are removed.

00:55.130 --> 01:00.430
So as you can see a very very long prompt but we've created a variable and we've decided this value.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.200
So what we want to do now is favorite Lechter

01:08.580 --> 01:11.070
equals input.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.510
So we're going to ask the user to input their favorite lecture.

01:13.810 --> 01:21.120
We're going to do it with a text from the prompt above OK and let's see what that gives us.

01:22.030 --> 01:26.520
So we save it and then we run a OK.

01:26.550 --> 01:31.020
So as you can see now this lecture is discussing platens input prompt and how to keep it tidy please

01:31.040 --> 01:35.420
at your favorite lecture so lecture once.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.450
OK.

01:36.490 --> 01:37.060
There we go.

01:37.150 --> 01:41.170
So don't forget when using the input function pioneered terabits everything that the user enters as

01:41.170 --> 01:41.820
a string.

01:42.010 --> 01:48.130
And also as we discussed before don't forget how to use the input function for numerical entries and

01:48.130 --> 01:50.680
to handle numerical entries from the user.

01:50.680 --> 01:56.920
We do so by using the function which tells Platon to treat the input as a numerical value the function

01:57.040 --> 02:01.420
converges a string representation of a number two in the miracle representation number and we look at

02:01.420 --> 02:04.420
that at our previous lecture on the input prompt.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.220
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
