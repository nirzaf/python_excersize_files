Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.160 --> 00:06.240
Now we've seen the for loop which takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once for

00:06.240 --> 00:07.940
each item in the collection.

00:07.950 --> 00:12.620
While loops don't as long or while a certain condition is true.

00:12.780 --> 00:16.320
Use a while loop to count from 1 to 10.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.730
So let's add in our comments first.

00:20.780 --> 00:23.060
Today's date is the second of November.

00:23.060 --> 00:27.520
Hard to believe that it's not very long till Christmas.

00:27.590 --> 00:30.670
The order is myself or you.

00:32.320 --> 00:38.180
Oh and using while loops.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.900
OK so let's have a look.

00:41.470 --> 00:49.120
So first you want to set our current number so variable current number is 1.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.000
Next we're going to introduce a while loop.

00:52.000 --> 01:05.460
So while our current number is less than or equal to 10 due to following print the current number and

01:05.460 --> 01:12.000
each time that happens at 1 and 1 record number so increase every time for a while loop.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.850
1 2 3 4 and so on.

01:13.890 --> 01:16.110
So let's run this and see what it looks like.

01:16.110 --> 01:16.920
Nice.

01:17.100 --> 01:22.110
OK so that is very simple introduction into a WHILE loop and a very effective demonstration.

01:22.110 --> 01:27.670
We start counting from one by setting the value of the current number to 1 the while loop is then set

01:27.670 --> 01:31.690
to run as long as the value of current number is less than or equal to 10.

01:31.690 --> 01:35.110
The code inside the loop prints the value of the current number and then adds 1.

01:35.140 --> 01:37.750
So a nice quick little introduction into why loops to here.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.720
I'm gonna be using them an awful lot in this section.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.460
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next Lechter.
