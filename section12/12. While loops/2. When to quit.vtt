Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.950 --> 00:06.550
Now we can also use a while loop to keep the program running until a user wants it to end.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.470
Let's take a look at how we might do that.

00:08.490 --> 00:13.340
So as you can see I started off with some comments and I'm back in my idol editor now.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.930
So let's start off at a prompt prompt.

00:16.590 --> 00:23.610
Equals going to put this on a new line backslash and.

00:23.710 --> 00:24.790
And this program

00:27.340 --> 00:39.810
anther Q OK now prompt We want to add to it now plus add the following line to the prompt and pull on

00:39.810 --> 00:40.670
a new line.

00:43.060 --> 00:47.490
Please and there your name

00:50.690 --> 00:53.130
OK and let's see now.

00:53.540 --> 00:55.820
OK so we have two problems now.

00:55.850 --> 00:59.580
Next we're going to create a variable message on this very.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.700
It's just going to be essentially empty.

01:01.700 --> 01:14.450
So while our message does not equal Q Do the following message equals.

01:14.530 --> 01:17.740
So we're assigning our prompt to a message

01:21.360 --> 01:25.940
then we print our message which is the prompt.

01:26.030 --> 01:27.890
Now let's run this and see what happens.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.140
Well first let's save it.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.380
OK so it's saved.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.140
Now let's run to end this program.

01:34.140 --> 01:34.980
Enter queue.

01:35.020 --> 01:35.910
Please enter your name.

01:36.010 --> 01:39.580
Tony OK so will keep going.

01:39.580 --> 01:43.170
Keep going and then enter Q And it over.

01:44.420 --> 01:45.270
Perfect.

01:45.310 --> 01:50.060
So there's a quick program that you can use and will use now going forward to keep the programs running

01:50.390 --> 01:52.010
until the user wants them to end.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.950
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
