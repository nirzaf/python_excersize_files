Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.600 --> 00:07.580
Now there is another option to exit the while loop and that is to exit immediately without running any

00:07.580 --> 00:08.870
of the remaining code.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.170
This option is called the break statement.

00:11.210 --> 00:16.220
Let's look at an example in this program we ask users to enter the books they read recently.

00:16.250 --> 00:25.550
So what we have is promt equals new line.

00:25.550 --> 00:37.690
Please enter the name of a book you have read recently.

00:37.740 --> 00:40.420
OK so far so good.

00:40.630 --> 00:41.080
Prompt

00:44.770 --> 00:50.420
new line to quit type q.

00:50.620 --> 00:58.230
Now why don't you book input prompt.

01:00.910 --> 01:03.970
OK so simple enough so for now if book

01:07.060 --> 01:07.960
is equal to Q

01:11.080 --> 01:12.300
break.

01:12.550 --> 01:21.530
So if somebody understand Q A program will stop immediately else print.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.570
You have recently

01:27.640 --> 01:32.350
read space close or double quotes plus book

01:35.080 --> 01:36.210
dart title

01:40.470 --> 01:47.870
plus plus what now k.

01:48.110 --> 01:50.180
Let's say that and see what it gets us say.

01:50.180 --> 01:56.030
Now let's run please the name of a book you have read recently.

01:56.050 --> 02:02.220
So as you can probably guess and a bit of a Bach lover and I won't enter Elon Musk as I have done before.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.050
I will answer is the.

02:04.090 --> 02:09.170
Just so you know that I do read or books the Ferrum error.

02:09.190 --> 02:09.910
Error error.

02:09.910 --> 02:14.960
So where we got an error book typo I've misspelled title.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.050
OK let's have a look here.

02:17.050 --> 02:18.260
There we go.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.460
You've recently read plus book title.

02:20.470 --> 02:23.110
So let's say that and let's run it again.

02:25.520 --> 02:31.200
So far.

02:31.710 --> 02:34.370
Did not just spell that wrong again that I did.

02:36.060 --> 02:38.710
OK let's hope that's it.

02:38.740 --> 02:45.880
No what I'm going to do is I'm going to enter in a different box name so you know that I have even more

02:45.880 --> 02:51.510
than two books and they're in Titan which is a very big book about Rockefeller.

02:51.510 --> 02:55.560
There you go you've recently read Huyton present name of a book you've read recently pressed you to

02:55.560 --> 02:55.870
quit.

02:55.890 --> 02:58.120
Q Perfect.

02:58.140 --> 03:01.530
So another way to exit out of a while loop.

03:01.530 --> 03:07.190
So as you can see here we just jump back into our code so as you can see here our loop starts with while

03:07.210 --> 03:10.760
true and will run forever unless it reaches a break statement.

03:10.770 --> 03:16.200
The loop will continue until Q Is entered the break statement can be used in any of pipings loops which

03:16.200 --> 03:20.160
is a very nice handy piece of code and it's nice and clean and easy to write.

03:20.570 --> 03:23.400
OK thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next letter.
