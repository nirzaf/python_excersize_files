Hi everybody.

00:01.760 --> 00:02.890
Welcome back.

00:02.900 --> 00:07.970
Now instead of breaking out of a loop as we did in previous lecture you can use the continue statement

00:08.120 --> 00:11.950
to return to the beginning of the loop based on the result of a conditional test.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.600
So let's have a look at a quick example.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.170
So I'm still my idol code editor.

00:16.220 --> 00:17.130
So let's have a look.

00:17.210 --> 00:21.560
Current number equals zero.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.220
So we've seen this before.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.440
So while our current number

00:30.100 --> 00:39.970
is less than 10 due to following current number plus one

00:43.340 --> 00:44.420
if the current number

00:47.140 --> 00:50.770
this is one of the beautiful things that I like about Python is that when you're writing your programs

00:50.830 --> 00:52.280
it's very readable.

00:52.300 --> 00:58.000
It's almost like writing for a person just to sit down and read without knowing any pite because as

00:58.000 --> 01:00.650
you can see here this code is very user friendly.

01:00.730 --> 01:03.300
If you're coming at this from a blank slate.

01:03.610 --> 01:06.490
So if number modulars to

01:09.660 --> 01:12.900
0 continue

01:16.130 --> 01:26.780
and then print the current number that's saved us and let's run it.

01:28.540 --> 01:28.990
10.

01:29.000 --> 01:29.950
So there we go.

01:30.290 --> 01:35.200
So what we've done here is we've set a current number to zero.

01:35.390 --> 01:41.200
And while the current number is less than 10 I'd keep adding one so continuously add one.

01:41.400 --> 01:48.870
So if the current number is much less what is the current number much less to 0 continue.

01:48.900 --> 01:54.910
So here we go so we keep looping back to the start of our program and we print out a current number.

01:54.920 --> 02:00.070
Now while loop needs a way to stop running order wise it'll run forever.

02:00.090 --> 02:05.970
So in the last few lectures we've seen different examples of how to stop and break while loops.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.110
So whenever you get a program that keeps running and running and running and he can't seem to do anything

02:10.110 --> 02:14.730
with it or he can find the error go back and check your wire loops because it is possible that you've

02:14.730 --> 02:17.670
created an infinite loop that won't stop running.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.090
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
