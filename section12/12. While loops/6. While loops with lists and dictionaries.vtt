00:01.920 --> 00:03.390
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:03.390 --> 00:07.480
Now so far we've been working with only one piece of information at a time.

00:07.500 --> 00:11.850
We received the user's input and then printed in part or response to it.

00:12.060 --> 00:17.280
But to keep track of many users and piece and pieces of information we need to use lists and dictionaries

00:17.470 --> 00:22.020
which are while loops a for loop is very effective for looping through a list.

00:22.320 --> 00:27.360
But you shouldn't modify a list inside a for loop because Python will lose track of what you are doing

00:27.420 --> 00:31.250
and the items were in the list to modify a list as you work through it.

00:31.350 --> 00:33.150
Use a while loop.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.570
So we've mentioned before email subscription software and let's revisit that example now.

00:38.450 --> 00:43.490
Consider this scenario a user subscribes to our newsletter and we send them a verification email to

00:43.490 --> 00:45.010
verify the email address.

00:45.940 --> 00:50.950
After these users verify themselves how can we move them from our list of verified users to verified

00:50.950 --> 00:51.790
users.

00:51.850 --> 00:56.680
One way will be to use a while loop to take users from the unverified list as we verify them and then

00:56.710 --> 00:58.690
add them to a list of verified users.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.820
So let's take a look at how that program would look.

01:00.820 --> 01:05.060
Now we start off the list of unverified users.

01:05.770 --> 01:10.830
So let's add in our comments.

01:10.870 --> 01:14.140
OK so I just paused and added in some comments so you can see them there at the top.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.490
So as I said We start off with a list of unverified users.

01:18.010 --> 01:19.970
So let's add a comment to say that's what we're doing.

01:22.060 --> 01:27.080
Create a list of on verified users.

01:27.720 --> 01:28.570
OK.

01:29.080 --> 01:35.170
So unconfirmed users equals.

01:35.230 --> 01:38.570
OK so let's go back to our reliable Tony.

01:38.730 --> 01:42.850
Frank don't forget your single quotes.

01:42.850 --> 01:46.450
Very easy to forget even you're trying to go move to something promptly.

01:46.720 --> 01:47.440
Mary.

01:47.680 --> 01:48.200
OK.

01:48.370 --> 01:52.150
So a list of people who are subscribed to our newsletter but have not yet confirmed that they actually

01:52.150 --> 01:53.620
want it.

01:53.650 --> 02:03.890
Now another one an empty list to hold confirmed users.

02:03.900 --> 02:04.430
OK.

02:04.530 --> 02:05.540
Perfect.

02:06.120 --> 02:13.670
Let's create that list now confirmed users equals an empty list.

02:13.670 --> 02:14.760
There we go.

02:14.840 --> 02:20.420
Now we're going to create a while loop which runs as long as the list of unconfirmed users is not empty.

02:20.420 --> 02:22.810
So while unconfirmed

02:26.200 --> 02:26.890
current user

02:33.180 --> 02:33.720
equals

02:36.310 --> 02:37.270
unconfirmed user

02:40.440 --> 02:41.840
that pop.

02:41.850 --> 02:44.620
Now you might remember the pop method from an earlier lecture.

02:44.730 --> 02:50.220
And what that's going to do is it's going to take a user from unconfirmed users list and pop it into

02:50.220 --> 02:52.120
the variable current user.

02:52.350 --> 02:56.780
So when that's done print verifying

02:59.830 --> 03:09.650
user space plus current user data titles we want to capitalize their name

03:12.970 --> 03:18.050
and then we say confirmed users know we're accessing our confirmed users list that append.

03:18.130 --> 03:21.300
So add to that list current user.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.280
So all very straightforward.

03:24.040 --> 03:34.730
And now to print out our users we are just out in a statement display all confirmed users.

03:34.810 --> 03:35.480
OK.

03:35.480 --> 03:39.260
And in that we place print and paste this on a new line

03:42.190 --> 03:50.430
backslash and the following users have been confirmed

03:55.930 --> 03:56.440
today.

03:56.510 --> 04:03.070
We're going to do is going to look for confirmed use or in confirmed users

04:05.980 --> 04:06.370
present

04:10.060 --> 04:12.620
confirmed user data title.

04:12.880 --> 04:13.560
OK.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.410
So let's run this program and see what we get.

04:18.740 --> 04:21.990
Well an error pand and I've misspelt a Pand.

04:22.090 --> 04:22.910
OK.

04:23.140 --> 04:25.960
Remove the A and let's run it again.

04:26.200 --> 04:31.620
Verifying user Mary verifying user Frank verifying user Tony to follow users have been confirmed.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.260
OK so there's an interesting error.

04:33.460 --> 04:37.560
The following years have been confirmed but didn't matter type of string object.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.090
OK so let's see what that error is.

04:40.090 --> 04:41.120
Here we go.

04:41.140 --> 04:45.220
The title isn't working correctly so let's just add in our brackets which I forgot.

04:45.220 --> 04:46.200
Run it again.

04:46.310 --> 04:46.900
And there we go.

04:46.900 --> 04:47.700
Perfect.

04:47.710 --> 04:49.140
So let's just have a look at our program.

04:49.150 --> 04:52.020
So first we create a list of unconfirmed users.

04:52.030 --> 04:57.430
So again imagine our software scenario our e-mail software scenario and we have Tony Frank Ameri who

04:57.430 --> 05:01.530
clicked yes subscribe to the newsletter but they have not yet confirmed.

05:01.670 --> 05:04.340
So a list of confirmed users is empty.

05:04.720 --> 05:11.920
So while we have unconfirmed users create a variable current user and add to that variable unconfirmed

05:11.920 --> 05:20.110
users that pop out in one unconfirmed user at a time and then print verifying to user plus the current

05:20.110 --> 05:20.790
user.

05:20.980 --> 05:26.770
When that's done go to our confirmed users list which at the moment is empty and append panda in the

05:26.770 --> 05:27.610
current user.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.450
So that seems very simple and very straightforward and it is once you type this out and run it a couple

05:32.450 --> 05:35.460
of times you'll realize how simple it is.

05:35.470 --> 05:42.010
Finally we display all confirmed users and to do that we loop through or confirm use a list and print

05:42.020 --> 05:47.040
out each user in Title Case and you can see the result here.

05:47.050 --> 05:52.360
So in our program because Mary is the last of the unconfirmed users in the list.

05:52.370 --> 05:57.430
So you can see or hear Mary out of her and last her name will be forced be removed and stored in current

05:57.430 --> 05:59.510
user and atatÃ¼rk confirmed user list.

05:59.510 --> 06:02.520
So indeed you can see or hear and or confirmed views a list Mary.

06:02.910 --> 06:04.750
So I hope you found this letter interesting.

06:04.750 --> 06:09.210
I certainly did as it's more advancement on what we've been building up to so far.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.210
As always if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me and I'll see you in the next

06:13.210 --> 06:13.630
lecture.

06:13.690 --> 06:14.040
Thank you.
