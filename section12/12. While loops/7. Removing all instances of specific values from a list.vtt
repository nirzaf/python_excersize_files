Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.880 --> 00:08.220
Now with this short lecture we're going to look at how to remove all instances of a specific value from

00:08.220 --> 00:10.140
a list using a while loop.

00:10.140 --> 00:14.740
So previously we used to remove method to remove a specific value from alecks.

00:14.790 --> 00:19.300
This worked well because we only wanted to remove one specific value from a list.

00:19.710 --> 00:23.280
But what if we want to remove all instances of a value from a list.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.390
How would we go about that.

00:24.480 --> 00:25.570
Well let's take a look.

00:25.770 --> 00:26.620
OK Commons.

00:26.630 --> 00:32.490
And now let's create a list that we want remove items from LET'S GO books.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.590
So we haven't been following and following along and should be very obvious by now that I am a mass

00:36.610 --> 00:37.720
of Buchler.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.170
So let's go.

00:39.540 --> 00:43.560
OK so let me just look across my bookshelf now and have a look at some books are going.

00:43.560 --> 00:49.020
OK so let's go big data and all of these books I highly recommend you read.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.310
So big data.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.570
And let's have a look.

00:51.570 --> 00:52.350
Checklists

00:56.830 --> 00:58.530
what else.

00:58.540 --> 00:59.560
And the firm

01:03.890 --> 01:07.260
now because in this list we are going to remove specific values.

01:07.260 --> 01:12.680
What I want to do is I want to put a few repeating so after my next book I'm going to start adding in

01:12.830 --> 01:14.210
some duplications.

01:14.210 --> 01:17.600
So let's have a look one more book in here and let's see what we have.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.490
We have Teslas biography so let's go to Tesla.

01:21.550 --> 01:22.120
OK.

01:24.400 --> 01:29.330
Now out of this list which do I like the least when I can tell you it's the.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.880
Sorry if the author happens to be watching this video but it's true.

01:33.040 --> 01:36.900
So the firm let's just add in a new new lubrication to the fan.

01:36.940 --> 01:42.730
OK so we consider that the firm has been duplicated three times just for clarity.

01:42.740 --> 01:44.530
Let's print out our list.

01:44.540 --> 01:47.580
Print books.

01:47.750 --> 01:48.830
Let's run that.

01:49.220 --> 01:50.100
OK so there we go.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.310
And we can see the firm Debt-Free times.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.780
OK and let me just remove this print statement.

01:54.920 --> 01:58.400
So while the firm

02:02.050 --> 02:05.770
is in box so very easy to read this line here.

02:05.770 --> 02:11.020
So while the firm is in books books that remove

02:14.100 --> 02:16.450
the firm OK.

02:16.470 --> 02:23.910
Still very easy to read print books and let's see what we get.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.020
Now there we go.

02:26.130 --> 02:26.770
Excellent.

02:27.540 --> 02:32.980
A quick and simple way to remove all instances of a set of the same value from a list.

02:33.020 --> 02:33.470
OK.

02:33.490 --> 02:34.940
I hope you follow along with that lecture.

02:34.970 --> 02:37.940
And as always if you have any questions please reach out to me.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.690
