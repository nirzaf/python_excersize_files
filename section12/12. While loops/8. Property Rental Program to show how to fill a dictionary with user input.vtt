Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.530 --> 00:07.750
Now in this lecture we're going to look at filling a dictionary with a user's input so we can prompt

00:07.810 --> 00:12.520
as many times as we would like for user input with each Pastorale a while loop.

00:12.820 --> 00:17.770
Let's look now at a property renting program in which each passed through the loop prompts the users

00:17.830 --> 00:23.230
for property details which store the data we got in a dictionary because we want to connect each property

00:23.440 --> 00:24.660
with a particular user.

00:24.880 --> 00:28.560
So as you can see at the top I started off with some comments just the basics.

00:28.590 --> 00:35.480
Now the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create an empty dictionary create an empty dictionary.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.020
OK.

00:37.030 --> 00:39.520
And how we do that is we're going to call this rental properties

00:42.580 --> 00:46.920
he calls on our curly brackets now.

00:47.150 --> 00:51.590
Next thing we're going to do as we saw in the previous lecture is we're going to set a flag so set a

00:51.590 --> 00:54.650
flag to indicate

00:57.910 --> 01:01.030
we are taking applications for rental properties.

01:01.420 --> 01:05.380
Let's imagine that we are a real estate agency and we are looking for people to let us know if they

01:05.380 --> 01:10.510
have properties to rent so rental open.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.640
True.

01:12.460 --> 01:13.600
OK.

01:14.230 --> 01:17.360
Now why are rental open is true.

01:22.620 --> 01:29.180
So why would rental open and just let's add a comment here promp uses for a name and address so prompt

01:29.180 --> 01:36.510
users prompt for the user's name and address

01:39.870 --> 01:40.530
OK.

01:41.620 --> 01:49.100
So users name Eco's actually change that user name calls and put

01:53.040 --> 01:56.400
double quotes backslash newline.

01:56.530 --> 01:58.140
What is your name.

02:00.460 --> 02:01.120
OK.

02:01.390 --> 02:03.320
Now that he uses rental property

02:06.120 --> 02:09.390
that he goes and put on received the property

02:12.180 --> 02:21.110
what is the address of the property that you have to rent.

02:21.690 --> 02:22.800
OK there we go.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.400
Now what we want to do as we said at the beginning of this lecture is we want to store the responses

02:26.400 --> 02:29.590
from the users sort of responses in a dictionary

02:37.050 --> 02:42.210
so rental properties then we have our user name

02:45.570 --> 02:47.000
equals rental property

02:52.660 --> 02:53.640
OK.

02:53.690 --> 02:58.920
Now we'd like to do next is we'd like to ask if the user knows anybody else who might like to rent out

02:58.920 --> 02:59.380
a property.

02:59.370 --> 03:00.360
So we're looking for business

03:19.260 --> 03:22.770
repeat equals and put

03:26.810 --> 03:29.140
double quotes backslash and New Line

03:32.580 --> 03:32.890
do.

03:32.950 --> 03:43.520
No I only want who might like to rent out their property

03:47.220 --> 03:49.520
OK perfect.

03:49.650 --> 03:53.760
Now if Pete is no

03:57.240 --> 04:05.930
then Rantel open and I forgot my colon there then Rantel open becomes Fulks and a program will end.

04:05.930 --> 04:10.460
As we saw on a previous lecture so we're really putting together a lot of elements that we've seen in

04:10.460 --> 04:21.480
previous lectures and what that would mean then is adding our property is complete.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.240
So what we want to do is we want to print.

04:24.340 --> 04:32.580
We're going to use a nice little trick here so print new line backslash and we're going to go one to

04:32.590 --> 04:41.830
trade space property to rent one to three times a bracket.

04:41.830 --> 04:45.130
So for want to create a loop.

04:45.370 --> 04:53.720
So for user name and the rental property in rental properties

04:58.070 --> 05:00.070
items so we're looping as you can see

05:02.700 --> 05:03.150
print

05:06.950 --> 05:16.140
user name plus has plus then the rental property

05:18.750 --> 05:23.690
plus open quote space to rent.

05:23.810 --> 05:26.720
OK so this is probably one of the biggest programs that we've written so far.

05:27.610 --> 05:30.240
I want I'm going to do is because we need user input.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.370
I'm going to write I'm going to open this up in our idle program.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.940
So bear with me for one moment while I open up idle.

05:36.130 --> 05:41.170
OK so here we are now an idle and let's cross our fingers and toes and run it.

05:41.670 --> 05:42.370
What is your name.

05:42.380 --> 05:44.750
Well my name is Tony Stone.

05:45.050 --> 05:45.860
OK.

05:46.060 --> 05:48.250
What is the address of the property that you have to rent.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.590
Well my property is one main street

05:53.480 --> 05:56.690
do I know do you know anyone who might like to rent out their property.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.530
No I don't.

05:57.530 --> 05:58.460
Not at the moment.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.450
Property to rent.

06:00.450 --> 06:06.390
Tony Stanton has 101 Main Street to rent so you can see how in the larger scale and larger thinking

06:06.390 --> 06:08.940
of a web application this can come into play.

06:08.940 --> 06:15.000
This could become a link into and we could click it to show more details of the property or even we

06:15.000 --> 06:18.420
can click on to use a name and that would bring us into the user name to show us all the properties

06:18.420 --> 06:20.790
that they have to rent because it could be a big company.

06:20.790 --> 06:25.500
So that is probably one the biggest programs we've written so far and it really is an excellent coming

06:25.500 --> 06:28.890
together of everything that we've learned so far throughout the course.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.210
I hope that all made sense.

06:30.210 --> 06:34.440
If not please do not hesitate to contact me and thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next

06:34.440 --> 06:34.970
lecture.
