Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.800 --> 00:07.720
Now we're moving into a new section and that section is all about functions and I would just kick off

00:07.720 --> 00:10.270
by saying that functions are fantastic.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.920
They are terrific.

00:11.920 --> 00:17.980
Functions are named blocks of code that are designed to do one specific job when you want to program

00:18.040 --> 00:24.100
a specific task that you've defined in the function you call the name responsible for when you need

00:24.100 --> 00:26.720
to perform the same task multiple times in your program.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.710
You don't have to type the same code over and over again as we have been doing previously.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.940
You can just call the required function.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.110
So now let's take a look at a simple example.

00:35.260 --> 00:36.070
OK so here we are.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.910
So let's first off define our function.

00:37.930 --> 00:39.690
So we do that by DPF.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.310
Actually I'll add in some comments.

00:41.350 --> 00:47.900
OK so Collins and so we start by defining our function and we do that by typing DPF for the fine.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.400
And then it's followed by the name of the function.

00:50.440 --> 00:56.120
So we're going to call this function Hello World Hello world.

00:56.130 --> 00:59.410
Now we have no arguments to pass in the brackets so we leave that empty.

00:59.430 --> 01:03.510
Later on we'll see how we can put information in there next.

01:03.660 --> 01:09.570
Every function must have a description and we do that by first and bring in tree come tree double quotes

01:09.810 --> 01:11.330
and giving it a description.

01:13.210 --> 01:14.830
Displaying Hello world.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.810
And then Mikko's it with tradeable quotes.

01:18.860 --> 01:23.550
Next what we want the function to do what we want to print Hello world.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.350
So this is what we actually want the function to do itself.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.470
Hello world.

01:27.470 --> 01:29.260
Then finally we call the function.

01:29.300 --> 01:35.350
So our function name is hello world hello world.

01:35.350 --> 01:36.810
We have no arguments to pass.

01:37.010 --> 01:37.740
So that's it.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.520
And let's see what happens when we run that.

01:39.950 --> 01:40.810
OK there we go.

01:40.880 --> 01:41.730
Hello world.

01:41.970 --> 01:44.320
Let's just do a very quick recap.

01:44.360 --> 01:50.060
We defined a function PEF we entered in our function name followed by brackets and a colon.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.190
We then opened up our function's comment.

01:52.220 --> 01:57.660
Our function description would treat double quotes displaying Hello World and close it off untradable

01:57.770 --> 01:58.480
quote.

01:58.490 --> 02:01.010
Then we entered in what we wanted our function to do.

02:01.010 --> 02:04.300
So in this case we just wanted to print out a simple Hello World message.

02:04.340 --> 02:07.480
Following that we call the actual function itself.

02:07.580 --> 02:12.770
So as we gave her name Hello World to the function we call that again at the end and when we run it

02:12.770 --> 02:14.660
prints out our function troat this section.

02:14.670 --> 02:19.010
Now we're going to look at how we can get more features from our functions.

02:19.070 --> 02:21.140
So thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
