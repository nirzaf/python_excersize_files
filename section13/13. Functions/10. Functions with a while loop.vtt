00:00.890 --> 00:03.020
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:03.020 --> 00:06.440
Now in this lecture we're going to look at using a while loop what are functions.

00:06.650 --> 00:11.820
So what are functions we can use only in all of appliance data structures that we've just got so far.

00:12.080 --> 00:17.200
So now this lecture lets out a one loop to one of our previous program which was our formatted name

00:17.210 --> 00:17.880
program.

00:18.050 --> 00:24.260
So what I've done is I've gone out and I copied and pasted back in here are formatted name program or

00:24.260 --> 00:26.100
code from an earlier lecture.

00:26.180 --> 00:31.370
And the only thing I've changed is I've had that underscore to the front of our function name.

00:31.370 --> 00:33.960
So go ahead and do that now.

00:35.150 --> 00:36.460
OK welcome back.

00:36.470 --> 00:40.040
So once you have that copy and paste it don't what you need to do is you need to add in the following

00:40.700 --> 00:41.440
wild fruit.

00:41.430 --> 00:42.600
So we're using our flag.

00:42.980 --> 00:46.220
Wild fruit print

00:49.610 --> 00:52.090
backslash and so new line.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.100
What is your name.

00:54.700 --> 00:55.160
OK.

00:55.180 --> 00:59.150
Close or quote's closer brackets.

00:59.150 --> 01:00.050
So first name

01:03.770 --> 01:07.370
equals import because we're taking input from the user this time.

01:07.460 --> 01:10.100
That's why I'm in my idle and not my subline Id

01:13.020 --> 01:13.660
first name

01:22.160 --> 01:25.090
last name equals input

01:31.170 --> 01:32.220
last name.

01:32.720 --> 01:33.210
OK.

01:33.230 --> 01:35.750
Closer quotes close our brackets.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.230
Next we want our format names.

01:37.230 --> 01:45.350
Let's create a variable formatted name to take our functions are formatted name equals get formatted

01:45.350 --> 01:50.900
name and the arguments of pass that are first name

01:54.050 --> 01:55.460
and last name.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.280
OK there we go.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.730
And then finally print

02:03.290 --> 02:03.790
backslash.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.660
And so we have a nice clean line.

02:05.840 --> 02:16.580
Hello come space closer quotes plus formatted name plus

02:22.940 --> 02:24.560
exclamation point closer brackets.

02:24.620 --> 02:24.950
OK.

02:24.990 --> 02:27.050
Let's run that and see what we get.

02:27.050 --> 02:30.470
First we have to save it and then run it.

02:31.370 --> 02:32.950
OK what is your name first name.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.340
Tony last name standon.

02:37.060 --> 02:39.130
OK let's just give it a go first name.

02:39.140 --> 02:43.530
Jim last name Smith OK.

02:43.520 --> 02:49.050
So as you can see here I did lowercase Jim lowercase Smith and it gave me a nice clean formatted.

02:49.090 --> 02:53.840
Jim Smith but you might notice now it was a problem.

02:54.040 --> 03:00.240
Frank Murphy our program just keeps going keeps going keeps going there is no way to exit this program

03:00.250 --> 03:03.730
there's no break there's no there's no way to quit There's no way to stop.

03:03.730 --> 03:04.700
So how do we do that.

03:04.840 --> 03:10.950
Well let's look at changing our wild statement now and adding in the option to quit our program.

03:10.960 --> 03:15.970
So let me close this kill it yes kill what we want to do.

03:15.970 --> 03:20.650
Now if you want to edit this with our new code and how do we do that for us you need to just zap all

03:20.650 --> 03:21.520
of this here.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.270
So let's zap this.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.290
Here we go.

03:24.540 --> 03:27.760
And we need to keep our wild through.

03:27.860 --> 03:28.630
We have print

03:31.530 --> 03:32.520
backslash and

03:35.670 --> 03:38.170
what is your name so similar as before.

03:38.170 --> 03:44.000
Question macros are quote bracket's print and this is a different part now.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.050
Press Q

03:51.610 --> 03:57.280
At any time to quit this program

04:01.220 --> 04:03.010
so now we are back to our first name.

04:03.010 --> 04:07.650
So first name he quotes and put

04:14.230 --> 04:14.770
us name

04:21.400 --> 04:23.720
and we're going to say no here if first name

04:27.650 --> 04:28.430
is Q..

04:28.520 --> 04:34.100
So somebody typed in Q break so forget your colon break.

04:36.970 --> 04:41.060
And going do something very similar with our last name so last name equals input

04:43.730 --> 04:53.000
brackets quote last name closer quote closer brackets if last name

04:56.360 --> 04:57.180
is q.

04:57.410 --> 05:10.730
So if the user types in Q break so now we can actually exit our program so format name equals get formatted

05:10.730 --> 05:11.060
name

05:15.770 --> 05:16.440
first name

05:19.660 --> 05:20.510
last name.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.750
Close brackets and then print

05:28.470 --> 05:36.900
backslash and hello Comus space close or quote Plus formatted name

05:41.500 --> 05:44.110
plus exclamation point.

05:44.780 --> 05:45.710
Close quote.

05:45.910 --> 05:50.490
OK so now let's just have a quick look what we total user here is at the time press cute.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.400
Exit the program then.

05:52.420 --> 05:56.660
We've asked for user input of our first name and we've added an if statement here.

05:56.710 --> 05:58.480
If the first name is q.

05:58.690 --> 06:02.030
Break down for us of someone whose name happens to be Q We're out of luck.

06:02.260 --> 06:07.530
So if first name is q break and then the same last name is last name is q break.

06:07.550 --> 06:10.270
Otherwise print out Hello under formatted name.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.920
Now let's save this and run it and see what we get.

06:15.060 --> 06:16.020
What is your name.

06:16.290 --> 06:23.860
So Tony your case stones in lowercase nicely formatted Q quits.

06:23.910 --> 06:24.920
Nothing happens.

06:25.030 --> 06:27.610
So in this lecture we've looked at a couple of pieces now.

06:27.840 --> 06:32.610
We've looked at how to put a wire loop into our functions and also how to use the break statement to

06:32.610 --> 06:34.770
exit programs whenever the user wants.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.780
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
