Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.920 --> 00:07.360
Now it is often necessary and sometimes very very useful to be able to pass a list to your functions.

00:07.470 --> 00:11.650
Your function will then have direct access to the list and it's all of its contents.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.880
So let's get started now by doing exactly that.

00:13.920 --> 00:19.010
And as you can see here my comments passing at least to a function.

00:19.970 --> 00:23.040
Okay perfect so we start off defining our function DPF.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.140
This is going to be an online book retailer.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.100
So let's go books available.

00:27.150 --> 00:31.010
So we want to be able to display a list of books available to our users that they can buy.

00:31.180 --> 00:44.280
So books available and this will have one parameter box then are come and show a list of books available

00:44.520 --> 00:45.110
to buy.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.780
Okay perfect.

00:47.820 --> 00:53.040
Next we create a for loop for book and books

00:56.200 --> 01:03.680
we create the variable books in stock which is just a whole list of books really books in stock equals

01:06.710 --> 01:10.580
the following title is available

01:13.270 --> 01:13.980
Dubai.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.290
OK.

01:15.900 --> 01:20.120
Space plus book title.

01:20.130 --> 01:22.210
Make sure it's capitalized where necessary.

01:22.590 --> 01:23.980
Plus full stop

01:26.550 --> 01:27.820
perfect.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.920
Then we print that variable.

01:30.960 --> 01:36.920
We want to print that line out for every book that will go into our list books in stock.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.450
We go now to wrap this up.

01:40.530 --> 01:45.420
We create our list of books so this will be a list of books that we have in stock that will be available

01:45.420 --> 01:48.240
to display on the Web site and purchased by the user.

01:48.240 --> 01:54.610
So let's just call it available equals let's populate our list.

01:54.660 --> 01:55.410
Elon Musk

01:59.910 --> 02:02.280
come up the everything store

02:06.060 --> 02:09.840
come up and the growth map.

02:09.990 --> 02:11.920
Nice new addition to our list of books.

02:11.940 --> 02:13.110
OK there we go.

02:13.110 --> 02:15.450
Then finally books are available.

02:15.450 --> 02:18.790
So we're calling our function to that function.

02:18.840 --> 02:19.920
We pass our list.

02:19.920 --> 02:24.560
So Available Now let's print this out and see what happens.

02:24.780 --> 02:26.530
The Fulham title is available to buy.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.430
Elon Musk The Everything Store to grow up.

02:29.430 --> 02:34.620
So we start off by creating books available which is our function it expects a list of books available

02:34.650 --> 02:39.990
which is stores in the parameter books to function loops through the list it receives and puts each

02:39.990 --> 02:42.610
book in an available to buy message.

02:42.690 --> 02:48.860
We define a list of books and then pass a list of books to books available in our function call.

02:48.870 --> 02:53.240
I hope that made sense if not please don't hesitate to ask me in the Q and A section.

02:53.460 --> 02:56.060
And as always thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
