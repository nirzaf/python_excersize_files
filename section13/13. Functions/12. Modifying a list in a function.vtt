00:00.390 --> 00:01.840
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.860 --> 00:03.450
Now this lecture is a nice big chunky one.

00:03.480 --> 00:04.850
So let's get straight in.

00:05.010 --> 00:08.390
And this lecture is all about modifying a list within a function.

00:08.700 --> 00:13.620
So when we pass a list to a function the function can modify that list any changes we make the list

00:13.650 --> 00:15.450
within the function are permanent.

00:15.660 --> 00:20.460
Let's look an example consider an airline checking in system.

00:20.490 --> 00:25.140
So we have two types of passengers passengers that are not checked in on passengers that are checked

00:25.140 --> 00:25.850
in.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.250
So our software is going to do two things.

00:28.380 --> 00:30.970
It's going to list out the passengers who are not checked in.

00:31.020 --> 00:35.460
It's going to take them from the not checked in list and it's going to move them in to a chaplain list

00:35.550 --> 00:41.720
so passengers who are being confirmed to check in we're going to do this using two functions each one

00:41.720 --> 00:43.000
doing a specific job.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.610
One will handle do not check them passengers.

00:45.810 --> 00:50.540
And one will handle the checked passengers and each will print out a summary of passengers not checked

00:50.540 --> 00:52.390
in and checked in.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.650
So let's get started.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.310
That's the final function.

00:55.310 --> 00:57.230
So the passengers

01:01.550 --> 01:08.890
are going to have two parameters in here not checked and not checked and checked in

01:11.600 --> 01:14.250
OK.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.770
So let's give it description.

01:16.890 --> 01:26.420
Simulate passengers who are not checked in.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.290
Now here we go.

01:27.670 --> 01:28.380
So while

01:31.160 --> 01:36.270
not checked in now we're going to create a new variable here.

01:36.450 --> 01:39.010
So why not check in our current passenger.

01:39.010 --> 01:41.460
So imagine you're walking up to the check in desk at an airport.

01:41.470 --> 01:43.240
You are the current passenger.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.230
So our current passenger

01:47.710 --> 01:49.540
equals not checked in.

01:49.570 --> 01:53.090
Obviously you are not checked in yet you have just walked up to the check in desk.

01:53.270 --> 01:58.640
So what we want to do are not checked in passengers as pop each one from the list as they check in.

01:58.660 --> 02:04.270
So let's just add in a comment here simulates checking a passenger in

02:08.620 --> 02:09.480
and how do we do that.

02:09.490 --> 02:17.620
Well we give a print message print open up a quote checking in passenger

02:20.470 --> 02:25.060
and then we have colon space plus current passenger

02:29.930 --> 02:37.970
checked in pand Corrin passenger OK.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.450
Let's just briefly run through this wild statement again.

02:41.450 --> 02:43.810
So while are not checked and passengers.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.920
So for any passengers who are not checked in.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.800
Create a new variable called current passenger and assign that variable.

02:51.980 --> 02:57.250
One passenger at a time from are not checked in list so are popping off from the list one at a time.

02:57.350 --> 02:58.340
Next.

02:58.340 --> 03:02.580
Print out a message that says checking in passenger and current passenger.

03:02.750 --> 03:08.660
Then once that's done move the current passenger into our checked end list so that all sounds pretty

03:08.670 --> 03:13.320
straightforward and exactly what would happen if you were a passenger who is checking in at an airport.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.850
Now our second function show checked

03:20.170 --> 03:22.460
I spelt that right check in passengers.

03:22.510 --> 03:26.760
So you can tell straight away what this function is going to do.

03:26.940 --> 03:27.430
Checked in

03:30.630 --> 03:32.300
don't forget your colon.

03:33.240 --> 03:42.840
Open up your comments show all the passengers who have checked in.

03:43.580 --> 03:48.030
Know you've checked in at the front desk you've obviously been moved to checked in list because you've

03:48.030 --> 03:49.920
got your boarding pass or whatever it might be.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.540
And then you've gone through security.

03:51.540 --> 03:52.200
So print

03:55.470 --> 04:01.360
backslash and nice new line the following passengers.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.350
Have been checked in

04:12.190 --> 04:12.650
OK.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.630
What's next.

04:13.640 --> 04:20.720
Well for passengers in checked in or checked enlist print

04:23.340 --> 04:27.150
passengers something similar to what we've seen before.

04:27.210 --> 04:34.040
Now we want to create our two lists not checked in equals.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.760
We're going to do one passenger at the moment which is going to be myself just to make sure that we're

04:37.760 --> 04:39.020
working OK.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.670
Tony Staunton

04:43.420 --> 04:45.830
checked in is empty.

04:46.060 --> 04:46.720
Why is it empty.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.860
Because we're going to move to the list of non checked in passengers to checked in.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.540
So wandless will become the order essentially.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.420
Now we call two functions.

04:55.420 --> 05:03.310
First function is passengers and in that function we have to we passed two arguments not checked in

05:04.090 --> 05:06.590
and checked in.

05:06.590 --> 05:08.410
Next we call a second function.

05:08.420 --> 05:13.920
Show checked in passengers were only passing that one argument checked in.

05:13.930 --> 05:16.110
Now there's a lot going on there.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.200
Let's run this and keep our fingers crossed.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.370
And we have an error at line 18.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.250
That's the for passengers checked in.

05:26.260 --> 05:29.150
I forgot my colon.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.660
It's always one of my downfalls for getting the call and I don't know why going too fast.

05:32.670 --> 05:39.050
I suppose I do run it again like 19 print passengers because I forgot my colon it didn't invent.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.830
Let's try it again.

05:40.830 --> 05:41.550
Third time lucky.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.330
There we go check again passenger Tony Staunton.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.260
The following passengers have been checked in.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.140
Tony Staunton.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.290
OK so let's just expand out our list here.

05:49.290 --> 05:51.880
Now let's go with Sam.

05:52.170 --> 05:53.340
Mary Murphy

05:57.470 --> 06:07.930
let's go which Frank Waters and let's add one more for luck and let's go with Sam Smith no relation

06:07.930 --> 06:08.850
to the singer.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.200
Let's run this again.

06:10.690 --> 06:11.190
There we go.

06:11.190 --> 06:12.880
Checking in passenger Sam Smith.

06:12.880 --> 06:18.300
Frank Waters Mary Murphy Tony Staunton the fallen passengers have been checked into the space.

06:18.310 --> 06:19.860
And Frank so we can just remove that.

06:20.110 --> 06:25.690
So again let's just run through this quickly through this code to make sure we understand exactly what's

06:25.690 --> 06:27.040
going on.

06:27.100 --> 06:31.510
So we start off by defining our first function and this function is going to simulate passengers who

06:31.510 --> 06:32.820
are not checked in.

06:32.830 --> 06:36.320
Our function has two parameters not checked in and checked in.

06:36.670 --> 06:42.530
So while we have passengers in our not checked in the current passenger equals not checked in pop.

06:42.600 --> 06:48.070
So no one passenger at a time from our checked and not checked in list to the current passenger then

06:48.400 --> 06:55.020
print a message saying checking in passenger current passenger next move the current passenger into

06:55.020 --> 06:56.030
our checked in list.

06:56.170 --> 06:56.680
OK.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.740
Simple.

06:58.390 --> 07:00.090
Well kind of simple.

07:00.700 --> 07:06.250
Following that we have our second function show checked in passengers that has one parameter checked

07:06.250 --> 07:06.900
in.

07:07.300 --> 07:12.100
So our comment here so all the passengers who have checked in print the following passengers checked

07:12.100 --> 07:12.700
in.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.860
So four passengers in our checked in list print passengers.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.150
So that's a simple loop.

07:17.340 --> 07:21.010
We're looping through the passengers and are checked in list until there are none left.

07:21.010 --> 07:27.400
Following that we create two lists not checked in and checked in and then finally we call two functions

07:27.560 --> 07:33.730
pass that the arguments needed not checked in and checked in which are lists essentially our first list

07:34.180 --> 07:36.750
as a list of three or four not checked them passengers.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.770
On our second list is empty.

07:39.100 --> 07:45.040
But when we go through our functions the second list checked in is full of our passengers and other

07:45.040 --> 07:45.520
passengers.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.840
A lot of checked in checked out whatever it might be.

07:47.980 --> 07:51.930
So run to this function and through this program a couple of times to make sure that you understand

07:51.930 --> 07:55.190
it and you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

07:55.300 --> 07:55.750
Thank you.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.020
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
