Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.260 --> 00:06.760
Now in this short lecture we're going to look at how to prevent a function from modifying a list.

00:06.760 --> 00:11.650
So I have here on the left hand side of our screen our last lecture and all the code that was involved

00:11.650 --> 00:18.510
in dush And as you know in this lecture we modified the not checked in list to become detect check list.

00:18.640 --> 00:23.770
And as I said in this lecture as soon as we move a passenger from not checked in to check in the checked

00:23.770 --> 00:25.240
and list becomes empty.

00:25.240 --> 00:29.390
So every time we remove a person from this list that's it they're gone there's no getting them back.

00:29.410 --> 00:31.120
So you may not always want to do this.

00:31.210 --> 00:36.160
You may decide you want to keep a copy of the not checked in people now for whatever reason that might

00:36.160 --> 00:39.930
be you're dealing with you might always have to keep a copy of the original list.

00:40.210 --> 00:45.210
Well we can address this issue by passing the function a copy of the list of the changes made but the

00:45.220 --> 00:49.390
function will only affect the copy you can send a copy of a list to a function like this.

00:49.390 --> 01:00.110
Let's use the function from The Last Lecture passengers list name square brackets and a colon inside.

01:00.120 --> 01:06.310
And that's what's called the slice or a slice slice notation the slice notation makes a copy of the

01:06.310 --> 01:08.140
list to send to the function.

01:08.140 --> 01:14.750
If we didn't want to empty the list of not checked then passengers in our passengers function we could

01:14.750 --> 01:18.590
call the passengers function like this.

01:18.590 --> 01:24.910
So passengers are the same as above and in our last lecture not checked in

01:27.740 --> 01:28.830
not checked in.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.820
And then we want to make a copy.

01:30.830 --> 01:35.260
We want to pass the function a copy of a list of the list not the original list.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.560
Checked in and that's how we would do it there.

01:42.570 --> 01:47.040
So the only drawback to using a copy of a letter is that it creates more memory usage in your system

01:47.070 --> 01:48.170
and in your program.

01:48.330 --> 01:51.310
So if possible always use the original of your list.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.430
I hope that made sense.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.210
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
