00:00.210 --> 00:01.410
Everybody and welcome back.

00:01.410 --> 00:04.790
This is just a brief lecture to improve upon our past and your creation program.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.620
In our last lecture so as I said at the end of our last lecture we can add in a loop the loop to our

00:09.630 --> 00:10.780
passenger request.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.900
So we're starting from scratch to help our muscle memory.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.100
So crate passenger

00:17.830 --> 00:24.760
Asterix to allow for an arbitrary number of arguments to pass to the parameter requests and our function

00:24.760 --> 00:25.930
summary as always

00:28.430 --> 00:33.710
summarized passenger requests and we go.

00:33.710 --> 00:37.000
Close it off print.

00:40.550 --> 00:48.560
New Line this passenger is capitalized that this passenger has requested

00:52.960 --> 00:58.660
as requested Colon's space for request

01:01.320 --> 01:02.270
in requests

01:05.680 --> 01:06.100
print

01:09.450 --> 01:12.270
put in a little hyphen just to make our code nice and clean.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.940
Plus requests

01:17.490 --> 01:21.660
now find that we call our function Craig passenger

01:24.590 --> 01:25.220
window seat

01:31.810 --> 01:32.570
top of plane

01:35.650 --> 01:41.590
and breakfast.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.420
Now let's see what happens when we run this.

01:44.430 --> 01:44.940
There we go.

01:44.940 --> 01:50.070
This passenger has requested window seat type of plane breakfast and you can imagine combining this

01:50.070 --> 01:55.080
little program with our programs from previous lectures where we checking in passengers and we're able

01:55.080 --> 01:57.720
to say passenger Tony Stodden has checked in.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.070
He has requested the following.

01:59.070 --> 02:03.330
Window seat type of plane breakfast so you can really see lecture by lecturer.

02:03.330 --> 02:07.350
We're building upon what we've learned we're adding structured what we've learned and we have the ability

02:07.350 --> 02:09.930
to expand and approve our programs.

02:09.930 --> 02:10.940
I hope this helps.

02:10.980 --> 02:14.370
As always if you've any questions please let me know and I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:14.370 --> 02:14.950
Thank you.
