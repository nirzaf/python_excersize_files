Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:03.440 --> 00:08.160
Now so far we've seen several different types of arguments including position on an arbitrary.

00:08.180 --> 00:11.340
Now we do have to believe we're implied and to mix those two together.

00:11.630 --> 00:16.070
So we want the function to accept several different kinds of arguments the parameters that can accept

00:16.160 --> 00:19.850
arbitrary numbers of arguments must be placed last.

00:19.910 --> 00:23.770
So as we saw in our last one we had airplane requests from a passenger.

00:23.840 --> 00:28.670
So we would have to put asterisks request last in our parameters list.

00:28.760 --> 00:33.950
So we'll see how that looks now in a second what pite and then does is it match just a position on keyword

00:33.950 --> 00:37.590
arguments and then connects the remaining arguments in the final parameter.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.800
So let's have a look at how we would do that.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.920
So as always the f you can see my comments at the top positional arbitrary arguments together.

00:45.410 --> 00:51.910
So what we're going to do here now is we're going to push our passenger request on a seat number to

00:51.900 --> 00:52.300
get it.

00:52.370 --> 00:53.260
So let's do that now.

00:53.270 --> 00:58.760
So we're going to assign seat.

00:59.020 --> 01:02.600
So we have seats and then we will have requests

01:07.130 --> 01:08.270
as always with our clients

01:11.000 --> 01:15.070
assign a seat and requests

01:18.010 --> 01:19.700
to a passenger.

01:20.710 --> 01:22.740
OK close that off now.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.350
So print

01:29.520 --> 01:38.220
backslash newline the sign seat and what we'll do now is because seat is going to be a number.

01:38.300 --> 01:45.450
So they say assigned seats base plus we'd have to change that's seat number into a string string seat

01:48.580 --> 01:49.030
plus

01:52.410 --> 01:55.910
Fahlman Quest's.

01:56.150 --> 02:04.010
Plus don't forget your quotes to make this back into a string assigned seat number actually put seat

02:04.010 --> 02:06.850
number into us so assigned seat number

02:10.260 --> 02:17.630
took up his seat number 0 0 1 the following passenger

02:20.400 --> 02:22.310
requests.

02:22.350 --> 02:26.210
OK there we go and close that off.

02:26.290 --> 02:31.880
So for request in request.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.430
So like we had in the last lecture

02:36.320 --> 02:36.800
Prince

02:41.110 --> 02:43.680
hyphen class request

02:46.470 --> 02:55.010
and now what we need to do is we need to call our definitions so sign seat get a seat number of bombs

02:55.020 --> 02:56.230
my birthday yesterday.

02:56.380 --> 02:57.360
Thirty six.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.610
Not saying anything about my age and let's give them a window seat.

03:03.980 --> 03:04.700
OK.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.270
Let's see if that works.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.120
There we go.

03:08.120 --> 03:12.290
Assigned seat number 36 the following passenger request a window seat.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.940
So once again we can build on the previous lectures that we've done and we can look at building up a

03:16.970 --> 03:20.840
complete program as we move to all these functions.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.720
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
