00:00.330 --> 00:01.820
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.890 --> 00:06.120
Now so far we've been storing our functions in our main programs but we can go a step forward in this

00:06.270 --> 00:09.310
by storing our functions in a separate file called a module.

00:09.360 --> 00:14.220
We can then import that module into our main program an import statement tells Python to make the code

00:14.220 --> 00:16.740
in our module available in the currently running program.

00:17.980 --> 00:22.450
Storing your functions in a separate file allows you to reuse them in different programs and to also

00:22.540 --> 00:25.390
share them out with many different developers.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.000
So there are several ways to import a module.

00:27.010 --> 00:28.740
And let's take a look at one now.

00:29.050 --> 00:32.600
In this lecture we're going to look at how to import an entire module.

00:32.650 --> 00:39.340
So as you can see here I have my comments and actually today is that tend to just change over here to

00:39.340 --> 00:44.740
the tent so you can see that jeweled screened my ID for this lecture and we'll get that down in a few

00:44.740 --> 00:45.500
minutes.

00:45.910 --> 00:50.800
So the name of this lecture is our module because it's going to be our module and then importing an

00:50.800 --> 00:52.280
entire module.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.620
So the first thing you need to do is to create a module and how do you do that.

00:55.780 --> 01:00.820
Well as you can see here I've come back to a previous lecture and I take it our function books available

01:00.900 --> 01:03.310
and pasted it in here.

01:03.360 --> 01:07.690
Now I've renamed this file sorry I've named this far because it's a new file.

01:07.740 --> 01:13.890
I've named this file books by IPY so module is a file ending in Y and it contains the code you want

01:13.890 --> 01:15.980
to import into your program.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.430
So this module here now is ready to be imported.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.990
Well it's almost ready to be imported.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.030
We have to make a couple of small changes.

01:22.170 --> 01:28.380
First we need to remove these two lines here and we remove those because we are going to be passing

01:28.380 --> 01:34.230
information from our main program modules simply contains our function only so that removes them.

01:34.230 --> 01:39.450
So as you can see now this is just our function and because we don't know how many books our main program

01:39.450 --> 01:45.000
is going to pass need to add in the Asterix stuff so that our function will take an arbitrary number

01:45.000 --> 01:46.810
of books from our program.

01:46.830 --> 01:47.960
So this is now a module.

01:47.970 --> 01:49.000
There we go.

01:49.530 --> 01:54.690
Let's say that and if we run it nothing happens so you can see here it runs without error but it doesn't

01:54.780 --> 01:58.650
output anything because there are no arguments passed to our books parameter.

01:58.650 --> 02:00.450
OK so that's a module created.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.380
So I hope that made sense now.

02:02.420 --> 02:03.900
Make a separate file.

02:04.230 --> 02:06.810
And I've done so here called Showbox available.

02:06.810 --> 02:11.190
Now make a separate file and I've done so here called shoebox available and it's worth saying at this

02:11.190 --> 02:15.880
point that both your module and your main program file have to be in the same directory.

02:15.930 --> 02:18.070
Otherwise your program is not going to run.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.710
So how do we import the module into a main file.

02:21.780 --> 02:29.920
Well we start off with import and then the module name and our module name is books to buy.

02:30.360 --> 02:34.210
OK let's see what happens if we run that nothing.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.070
Same as if we were actually run our Mudgal.

02:36.070 --> 02:38.880
It's empty because we haven't passed any information to a module.

02:38.890 --> 02:41.650
So in essence our module is running from our main program.

02:42.130 --> 02:47.450
When pliancy is the import keyword followed by the name of the module it knows to open the file box

02:47.470 --> 02:52.030
that by P Y and copy all the functions from it into our program.

02:52.060 --> 02:57.490
Now to actually call the function from the imported module entered the name of the module so the name

02:57.490 --> 02:59.350
of the module is books to buy.

02:59.410 --> 02:59.950
There we go.

02:59.950 --> 03:02.190
And as we said at the top import books to buy.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.430
So now we're going to tell the file that we've opened books that buy what modules we want from it and

03:06.430 --> 03:07.620
we do what it does.

03:07.900 --> 03:14.080
And in the name of the module books available books available.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.070
OK there we go.

03:16.150 --> 03:17.720
Now what happens if we just run this now.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.200
Well let's take a look.

03:19.370 --> 03:23.850
Nothing because again we haven't passed any information into the box parameter so let's have a look.

03:23.860 --> 03:24.920
Fixing that now.

03:25.200 --> 03:31.340
Then we follow our books available with brackets quotes and let's give it the name of the book Pilon

03:31.920 --> 03:32.700
mosque.

03:32.990 --> 03:34.190
OK.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.010
Now we're starting to look like it's going to pass information so let's run this.

03:38.210 --> 03:38.920
And there we go.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.760
The falling title is available to buy.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.760
Elon Musk OK.

03:42.860 --> 03:46.180
Let's try adding in some more information.

03:46.700 --> 03:50.000
The Everything Store here we go.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.130
Let's run it again.

03:51.530 --> 03:52.610
OK very good.

03:52.820 --> 03:55.840
So let's just recap quickly on what we've done.

03:56.030 --> 04:01.850
We copied and pasted a program from a previous lecture and removed everything but the actual function.

04:01.990 --> 04:05.680
So we removed the print and the information that we're feeding into the parameters.

04:06.020 --> 04:10.680
So once that's done that is now a module and a module is like any other pipe and program in that it's

04:10.720 --> 04:15.160
saved with a P Y but it only contains functions.

04:15.160 --> 04:20.230
Next we create a new file show books available duppy why we told this file that we want to import the

04:20.230 --> 04:21.880
module books to buy.

04:21.910 --> 04:25.610
That's the file name from our code over here from our file over here.

04:25.750 --> 04:29.470
Then to call the actual function we set books by which is the file name.

04:29.470 --> 04:36.590
So it's telling piping to go to this file then go to this function would in the module and insert the

04:36.590 --> 04:37.830
following information.

04:37.940 --> 04:44.300
The following arguments into the parameters would end the function once we do it as it runs.

04:44.450 --> 04:49.840
OK so I hope that made sense in the next lecture will look at importing specific functions not just

04:49.930 --> 04:51.370
the entire module.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.010
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next letter.
