00:00.180 --> 00:01.720
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.720 --> 00:07.200
Now in our last lecture we saw how to import an entire module into our main program and what that meant

00:07.410 --> 00:11.070
was that every function from the module was available in our main program.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.710
And this lecture we're going to look at importing just specific functions.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.440
Only one function.

00:16.440 --> 00:17.710
So let's look at how we do it.

00:17.940 --> 00:22.020
Well as you can see on the left hand side here I still have my books to buy modules open and I still

00:22.020 --> 00:26.910
have the force function that we had in our last lecture but I've also copied and pasted in a function

00:26.910 --> 00:28.010
from a previous lecture.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.880
That function is book description.

00:30.060 --> 00:35.190
And again I've removed the last couple of lines which fed information to the function and I remove the

00:35.190 --> 00:37.170
function's calling statement as well.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.460
So again if I were to run this now it doesn't do anything.

00:39.570 --> 00:40.440
You can see here.

00:40.590 --> 00:43.390
Zap zero doesn't do a thing.

00:43.410 --> 00:50.160
Now how do we import one specific function from our module of which we have two functions into our main

00:50.160 --> 00:50.780
program.

00:50.940 --> 00:52.710
Well let's look at how we do that now.

00:52.770 --> 01:00.680
So I'm going to change our first line and I'm going to say from so from books to buy so very English

01:00.680 --> 01:06.740
friendly so from our program books to buy from our Mudgal books to buy import and what function do I

01:06.740 --> 01:07.820
want to import.

01:07.820 --> 01:09.370
Well let's start off at our first function.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.750
So import books available.

01:11.930 --> 01:12.670
OK.

01:12.890 --> 01:18.440
So that is very English readable or very user friendly readable I suppose you might say from the Mudgal

01:18.440 --> 01:24.440
books to buy import function books available now because we are told that much information we can remove

01:24.440 --> 01:26.770
the module name here books to buy.

01:26.770 --> 01:29.340
So all we need is the function name books available.

01:29.510 --> 01:31.890
And the arguments that we are going to pass to it.

01:32.060 --> 01:33.540
So let me run this.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.200
There we go.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.330
The following titles available is available to buy.

01:36.350 --> 01:39.570
Elon Musk The Everything Store so very very simple.

01:39.620 --> 01:45.880
Now we could change that again and we could say import book description let's just do it.

01:46.430 --> 01:53.930
Book Description book DSC or IPT book description and we need to change this here.

01:53.930 --> 01:57.920
So actually I'll remove this line for the moment book description

02:02.980 --> 02:08.960
and the information that we have the past is the art or name because as we see here a book type is already

02:08.960 --> 02:09.980
a default setting.

02:09.980 --> 02:13.970
So we have the auto name so the auto name in this case let's say Ashley Vance

02:16.640 --> 02:21.760
somewhere Ashley Vance's ears burning listening to the wood all the time.

02:21.770 --> 02:23.990
We mentioned her name in these letters.

02:24.200 --> 02:30.020
So on this program there we go is a nonfiction book the author of this book is Ashley Vance.

02:30.020 --> 02:36.530
So as you can see there we're importing boat modules one a boat functions one at a time so we're only

02:36.530 --> 02:39.030
importing specific functions.

02:39.110 --> 02:45.080
Book Description and in the previous piece of code books available now the last lecture we imported

02:45.140 --> 02:46.880
the entire module into our program.

02:46.910 --> 02:51.700
But let's just say our module has one hundred functions in it and we only wanted to import two of them.

02:51.710 --> 02:52.390
How would we do that.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.360
Well we have to write separate from statements would we have to write separate programs and bring them

02:56.360 --> 02:57.040
all together.

02:57.210 --> 03:01.350
Probably we can separate out our functions and import more than one function with a comma.

03:01.490 --> 03:02.340
So here we go.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.940
Book Description actually let's just change the order of this.

03:05.150 --> 03:07.190
Let's go back to books available.

03:08.340 --> 03:09.840
Books available.

03:09.840 --> 03:17.960
So we're importing the first one books available comma books book description.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.690
There we go.

03:19.750 --> 03:23.990
So let's see when we do that stair runs fine.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.500
But without our force functions let's add in some information on a first function and a first function

03:28.560 --> 03:31.080
is books available.

03:31.530 --> 03:32.340
And let's go.

03:32.340 --> 03:33.090
Elon Musk

03:36.240 --> 03:37.260
and that's just oh.

03:37.300 --> 03:37.780
Elon.

03:37.830 --> 03:39.890
Oh don't be too happy with us.

03:40.080 --> 03:40.730
OK.

03:40.890 --> 03:42.750
Now let's just add in a line here.

03:42.780 --> 03:51.700
Print statement print and let's say this is our first function.

03:52.970 --> 03:53.900
Here we go.

03:54.300 --> 03:54.990
OK.

03:55.220 --> 04:03.260
And let's add another print statement here and say Print this is don't forget our opening double quotes.

04:03.380 --> 04:08.230
This is our second function.

04:10.400 --> 04:15.160
There we go and let's see what happens now when we run this there.

04:15.290 --> 04:19.640
This is our first function the following titles available by Elon Musk.

04:19.640 --> 04:20.770
And this is our second function.

04:20.780 --> 04:21.850
That's not exactly tidy.

04:21.850 --> 04:23.430
And why is that all the way up there.

04:23.530 --> 04:28.550
Once because they haven't put in a new line here because this much dysfunction in the module over here

04:28.550 --> 04:29.220
has a new line.

04:29.240 --> 04:36.230
Let's just remove that new line this and let's just put in a new line here new line.

04:36.290 --> 04:37.810
There we go and run it again.

04:38.180 --> 04:42.500
There you go Big cleaner and I've left in a backsliders.

04:42.510 --> 04:45.660
Let me just take that as we go and run it again.

04:46.200 --> 04:46.710
OK.

04:46.710 --> 04:50.440
The cleaner This is our first function to Fulham title is available to buy.

04:50.450 --> 04:54.840
Elon Musk and you can see that that is our first function comes from here.

04:54.840 --> 04:59.180
This is our second function this nonfiction book The order of this book is actually Vance.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.800
OK so we've broken that up quite nicely there actually.

05:02.250 --> 05:06.440
So that is how you inport specific functions into your main programs.

05:06.570 --> 05:10.850
So like I said you can import as many functions as you want using a comma.

05:10.860 --> 05:16.050
So if your if your module program took your module here has one hundred functions and you only want

05:16.050 --> 05:17.260
to try for them.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.000
You can do that with a comma.

05:19.020 --> 05:20.090
Hope all that made sense.

05:20.130 --> 05:22.020
If not please don't hesitate to ask me.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.740
I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.120
Thank you.
