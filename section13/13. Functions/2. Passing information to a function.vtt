Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.470 --> 00:07.960
Now we can update our Hello world function from our last lecture to not only say hello world but also

00:07.960 --> 00:11.090
give us back a name for a function to do this.

00:11.140 --> 00:15.400
We enter a username in the brackets of the function's definition of def.

00:15.430 --> 00:16.260
Hello world.

00:16.390 --> 00:18.050
So let's just do that now.

00:18.610 --> 00:22.760
So we started off again so we have our comments and we're going to start from scratch again.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.860
DPF Hello world.

00:27.650 --> 00:31.580
And now in the last one we know we know information to pass into our brackets what we're going to do

00:31.780 --> 00:32.590
now.

00:33.160 --> 00:39.470
So we add user name by adding user name here we allow a function to accept and the value of user name

00:39.470 --> 00:43.700
we specify our function now expects us to provide a value for user name.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.320
Each time we call it.

00:45.350 --> 00:49.010
So again let's describe our function and we do that with three double quotes

00:54.920 --> 00:56.730
showing a user name.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.090
OK.

00:58.100 --> 01:02.500
And because of a treatable quote again this time we go print Hello

01:07.810 --> 01:10.580
plus user name.

01:10.660 --> 01:14.080
Don't forget our title that we saw at the very beginning.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.310
Plus post-up.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.250
OK.

01:18.490 --> 01:24.030
The variable use a name and definition of hello world is an example of a parameter a piece of information.

01:24.040 --> 01:28.180
The function needs to do its job and then to finish off a program we enter in again.

01:28.180 --> 01:29.320
Hello world.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.840
But we must pass it some more information that we're going to give it or use name here Tony.

01:34.060 --> 01:39.130
The value Tony is an example of an argument an argument is a piece of information that is passed from

01:39.130 --> 01:42.750
a function call to a function or a function call is here.

01:42.880 --> 01:49.590
Hello world and this here beginning with F is our function when we call the function.

01:49.590 --> 01:53.880
We place the value we want the function to work with in the brackets.

01:53.940 --> 01:56.630
In this example the argument Tony was passed at a function.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.560
Hello world.

01:57.730 --> 02:00.850
And the value was stored in the parameter username.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.480
So let's run this and see what we get.

02:03.510 --> 02:04.120
There we go.

02:04.230 --> 02:09.330
Hello Tony capsulized would a full stop so not a very simple example.

02:09.340 --> 02:14.700
An introduction to functions this time about how we can pass information to a function and later lectures.

02:14.770 --> 02:19.740
We look at how we can do this dynamically without having the predefined argument as we did here.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.880
Thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next Lechter.
