Hi everybody and welcome back this quick lecture we're gonna look at how to get a function in an alias.

00:06.610 --> 00:09.050
So why would we want to give a function an alias.

00:09.280 --> 00:14.320
Well what happens if the name of your function that you're importing into your main program conflicts

00:14.320 --> 00:17.800
with an existing name or if the function name is simply too long.

00:18.010 --> 00:23.560
Well when this happens you can use an alias so that you can see I have my code my two programs open

00:23.560 --> 00:26.700
from the last lecture and what I'm going to do is I'm going to reduce this down.

00:26.710 --> 00:32.470
So I'm just gonna remove these two lines here and then I'm gonna remove the function book description

00:32.560 --> 00:34.110
from our import here.

00:34.390 --> 00:39.450
And what you do to create an alias is we can leave this import books available.

00:39.660 --> 00:45.190
So from our module books or buy import books available and it's books available which is the function

00:45.190 --> 00:49.540
name from over here as you can see books available or function name.

00:49.690 --> 00:58.000
So I'm going to make this an alias as B.A so be a sure for books available obviously then we just change

00:58.420 --> 01:04.490
our function name here to B.A. and we run it and see what happens.

01:04.810 --> 01:09.640
There we go works just as well.

01:09.660 --> 01:13.710
So here what we've done is we've given a box available function which are calling from our module books

01:13.720 --> 01:14.610
to buy.

01:14.780 --> 01:18.530
We're giving books available to function an alias.

01:19.020 --> 01:23.960
And then instead and then in our code instead of calling books available with the argument.

01:23.970 --> 01:25.770
Elon Musk We just say.

01:25.830 --> 01:30.050
And a program works just as well let's just delete that and run it again.

01:30.920 --> 01:31.430
There we go.

01:31.430 --> 01:38.610
Elon Musk let's change it just remove any doubts The Everything Store.

01:38.610 --> 01:40.670
There we go.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.220
This our first function the following tightness of the by The Everything Store.

01:44.220 --> 01:49.350
So all you can say see aces can be very helpful if you have conflicting names or if your function names

01:49.440 --> 01:51.060
are too long for your program.

01:51.060 --> 01:52.980
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
