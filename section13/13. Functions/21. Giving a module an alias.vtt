Hi everybody and welcome back in the previous lecture we saw how to give a function and and this lecture

00:04.980 --> 00:07.920
we're going to look at how to give a module an alias.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.850
So giving a module an alias allows you to call modular functions much more quickly.

00:12.950 --> 00:14.550
So let's look at how we would do that.

00:14.550 --> 00:19.890
So as you can see here again left hand side has my module open and on the right hand side I change it.

00:19.890 --> 00:21.770
Change the code around from a previous lecture.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.740
So do that now to match what I have on screen.

00:25.020 --> 00:28.980
So my import statement at the top is import books to buy.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.560
So import our full Mudgal books to buy.

00:31.650 --> 00:36.480
So as we saw in the previous lecture by saying import books to buy that opens up every function from

00:36.480 --> 00:37.470
our module.

00:37.920 --> 00:44.070
So that's import books to buy and let's get books by an alias let's call it boxed by let's just say

00:44.640 --> 00:49.460
as books to buy B2B OK books to buy.

00:49.470 --> 00:55.700
So down here we can remove books by the insert we can be run and there we go.

00:55.710 --> 00:57.850
Runs perfectly.

00:57.910 --> 01:03.080
That's just from do to ask books to buy this or for a function the following titles are available to

01:03.080 --> 01:05.150
buy the everything store.

01:05.150 --> 01:11.300
So by giving our modules an alias as we have just done it makes a function calls within our main program

01:11.510 --> 01:17.270
much quicker and much easier to use for a nice nice style tip helped make your program just a little

01:17.270 --> 01:18.460
bit quicker and cleaner.

01:18.590 --> 01:20.460
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
