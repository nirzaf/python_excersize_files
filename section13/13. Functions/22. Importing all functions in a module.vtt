Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.890 --> 00:06.270
Now just last year we're going to look at another way to import all functions in a module so you can

00:06.270 --> 00:11.890
tell applying to import every function in the module using the Asterix operator that symbol there.

00:11.910 --> 00:14.210
So how do we put that into our import statement.

00:14.280 --> 00:25.340
Well we say from books to buy from our module books to buy books to buy import Actrix import everything.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.660
Let's run that.

00:26.670 --> 00:27.150
There we go.

00:27.150 --> 00:27.720
Runs fine.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.840
I just clean this window here and import there.

00:30.900 --> 00:36.000
It runs the Asterix in the import statement tells and to copy every function from the module books to

00:36.000 --> 00:39.930
buy into our main program file because every function is imported.

00:39.930 --> 00:43.300
You can call each function by name without using dot notation.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.300
I don't recommend using this approach.

00:45.300 --> 00:50.520
The best approach is to import the functions or functions you want or import entire my module using

00:50.520 --> 00:56.070
dot notation and make your code a lot easier to read and a lot more user friendly for other programmers.

00:56.070 --> 00:58.210
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
