Hi everybody and welcome back this lecture it's just a short lecture to explain some more about passing

00:06.130 --> 00:07.770
arguments to a function.

00:08.150 --> 00:11.230
So a function definition can have multiple parameters.

00:11.230 --> 00:16.840
And as we saw previously the username here is what's called a parameter sort of function as we just

00:16.840 --> 00:21.600
said can have multiple parameters a function call may then need multiple arguments.

00:21.610 --> 00:23.270
So here we only have one parameter.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.440
So that means we only need to give it one argument which is here.

00:27.590 --> 00:32.490
But what happens if we had multiple parameters like user name use Name one two and three we would have

00:32.490 --> 00:33.190
to go.

00:33.270 --> 00:35.350
Name one name to name three.

00:35.520 --> 00:39.540
So it makes sense that we can pass arguments to our functions in a number of ways.

00:39.720 --> 00:45.000
We can use positional arguments keyword arguments and list and dictionaries of values.

00:45.030 --> 00:48.320
So the next few lectures we're going to be looking at each one of those in turn.

00:48.450 --> 00:50.370
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
