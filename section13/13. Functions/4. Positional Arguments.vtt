Hi everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're looking at positional arguments.

00:04.780 --> 00:10.020
So when we call a function and Python plight must match each argument in the function call with a parameter

00:10.050 --> 00:11.740
in the function definition.

00:11.760 --> 00:15.140
So the simplest way to do this is based on the order of arguments provided.

00:15.210 --> 00:20.500
So we saw at the last lecture values match this way are called positional arguments.

00:20.510 --> 00:26.760
See how this works consider a function that displays information about the one and only book topic the

00:26.760 --> 00:30.040
function tells us what type of book each one is and the author.

00:30.060 --> 00:32.260
So let's have a look at how we might do this.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.140
So as always we have some comments at the top.

00:35.170 --> 00:46.390
Let's now put in another comment creating our function and as we know we started off with DPF.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.130
I'm going to go.

00:47.130 --> 00:51.790
Book Description.

00:51.790 --> 01:00.680
Now we're going to put into practice here book type and also name.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.280
There we go there are two parameters.

01:03.330 --> 01:10.480
Don't forget your code next our triple double quotes which sounds like an oxymoron display.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.290
Book information.

01:17.270 --> 01:19.250
Let me close it off for quotes again.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.330
Now what do we actually want this function to do.

01:21.470 --> 01:28.540
Well for us we wanted to print and we want this to print on a new line.

01:28.610 --> 01:39.800
This book is a plus book type plus postop.

01:39.820 --> 01:44.080
OK so this book is or could be a science fiction it could be nonfiction it could be fiction it could

01:44.080 --> 01:47.340
be romance whatever it is whatever argument we pass into the parameter.

01:47.350 --> 01:50.160
That's what will be the next we want to print

01:53.100 --> 01:53.720
the author

01:56.390 --> 02:03.200
of this book is space plus name

02:05.780 --> 02:07.450
title make it nice and clean.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.270
Don't forget your brackets at the end of that title.

02:10.490 --> 02:13.420
Plus full stop.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.510
OK now we have to color function.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.660
So we have our function is called Book Description.

02:20.210 --> 02:23.710
And as we said we now need to match our arguments.

02:23.750 --> 02:26.100
So our first parameter is book type.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.380
So our argument must match that.

02:28.580 --> 02:29.570
So what is a book type.

02:29.570 --> 02:33.790
Well nonfiction is a book type.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.790
The next parameter is Autor name.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.110
So let's go.

02:37.110 --> 02:39.980
Ashley Vance.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.840
And in case you're wondering what book it is it's the everything store about an Amazon.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.000
OK so there we go.

02:46.090 --> 02:47.580
Let's run that and see what we get.

02:49.850 --> 02:51.150
This book is nonfiction.

02:51.230 --> 02:56.150
The author of this book is Ashley Vance and it's called lies and everything stereo that is very very

02:56.150 --> 02:59.160
nice very clean and a very handy function there.

02:59.750 --> 03:04.810
So what in functions and what inner programs we can call a function as many times as needed.

03:05.700 --> 03:11.030
So let's go again and let's go book description again.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.660
And let's say this is fiction.

03:17.160 --> 03:25.080
Don't forget your arguments have to be surrounded in single quotes and the author of this is Dan Brown.

03:25.440 --> 03:30.400
I'm sure most people are familiar with Dan Brown's work the Da Vinci Code and most recently inferno.

03:30.930 --> 03:32.070
OK here we go.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.000
Commanded Bay.

03:33.090 --> 03:35.280
There we are two little paragraphs.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.350
This book is nonfiction.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.420
The author of this book is Ashley Vance.

03:38.430 --> 03:39.420
This book is nonfiction.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.350
This book is fiction.

03:40.380 --> 03:44.410
The author of this book is Dan Brown as we can just see now.

03:44.810 --> 03:50.990
We have a promotors open our definition of our function book type and author name and an inner function

03:50.990 --> 03:57.850
call which is book description we put in our two arguments which must match our parameters.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.940
So as you can see and it's good idea and not to forget.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.090
Order matters in positional arguments.

04:03.110 --> 04:07.320
If we were a first order they would appear in our program in the wrong order.

04:07.370 --> 04:11.570
So always keep that in mind if you see any errors or any unexpected output.

04:11.570 --> 04:13.790
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
