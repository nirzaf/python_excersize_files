Hi everybody and welcome back and this lecture we're going to be looking at keyword arguments.

00:04.890 --> 00:10.500
So a keyword argument is a name value pair that your past will function you directly associate the name

00:10.560 --> 00:12.390
and the value in the argument.

00:12.390 --> 00:16.110
So when you pass the argument to the function there is no confusion.

00:16.180 --> 00:20.130
Also with keyword arguments the key word order does not matter.

00:20.170 --> 00:21.980
So let's have a look at how we will do this.

00:22.920 --> 00:28.260
So I start off with some comments positional arguments but this is going to change now to keyword arguments

00:28.660 --> 00:31.400
position arrogance was our last lecture.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.800
Keyword arguments Dario.

00:33.840 --> 00:38.240
Now let's start off by creating our function.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.140
Create a function.

00:40.580 --> 00:41.470
Perfect.

00:41.510 --> 00:42.150
And how do we do it.

00:42.170 --> 00:43.430
Well DPF.

00:43.760 --> 00:51.650
I'm going to stick with our book function or book description book description so we have book type

00:54.650 --> 00:56.340
and we have Oerter.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.730
OK there we go.

00:58.760 --> 00:59.570
Don't forget your colon.

00:59.570 --> 01:06.570
So then we have our tree quotes display Boake information.

01:06.620 --> 01:09.530
You always have to put in a description of your function.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.460
Now what do we want the function to do.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.290
Like a last lecture.

01:12.290 --> 01:17.970
We want to print a quote backslash new line.

01:17.970 --> 01:20.970
This is a lever.

01:20.980 --> 01:29.270
Quote There comes a quote there plus type plus book Space book.

01:29.320 --> 01:30.670
Forget reforming a sentence here.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.950
So in your quote you still need your spaces.

01:32.950 --> 01:36.220
Then we print the author

01:39.050 --> 01:44.960
is gone is the OT or is space plus water.

01:44.980 --> 01:45.390
Here we go.

01:45.390 --> 01:50.050
Plus postop OK.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.440
Those are brackets.

01:51.720 --> 01:55.070
No book description.

01:55.260 --> 01:59.310
So we're calling our function here is a function call and like we said here now what we're going to

01:59.310 --> 02:04.080
do is add in keyword arguments in the syntax of a name value pair.

02:04.200 --> 02:10.420
So we have both type and a of type type is nonfiction.

02:11.480 --> 02:22.310
So you can see now what I mean by keyword arguments and or author equals Brad Stone.

02:22.520 --> 02:31.530
OK so you can see here now that like previous lectures we start by creating our function.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.300
Next we have our two parameters book.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.650
Type an order.

02:34.890 --> 02:36.210
Then when we call our function.

02:36.210 --> 02:42.270
So when our functions call which is here we have book type equals nonfiction an order equals Broadstone.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.520
So there's no confusion here.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.840
Now as to what author and book type are.

02:47.030 --> 02:50.700
Let's run this and see what we get.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.980
There we go this nonfiction book.

02:52.980 --> 02:58.230
The author is Brad Stone and like an older electorate we clean this up by use the title method and other

02:58.230 --> 02:59.720
items within our function.

02:59.740 --> 03:01.040
Hope you found his lecture helpful.

03:01.110 --> 03:04.430
And as always if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

03:04.530 --> 03:04.860
Thank you.
