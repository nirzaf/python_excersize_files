Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.650 --> 00:06.870
Now in this lecture you're going to be looking at setting default values within a function.

00:06.880 --> 00:11.020
So when you create a function you can define default value for each parameter.

00:11.020 --> 00:15.940
If an argument for a parameter is provided in the function call Python uses that argument.

00:15.940 --> 00:18.680
If not it uses the parameters default value.

00:18.710 --> 00:20.780
So let's go back to our book program.

00:21.430 --> 00:27.450
So as always start out with T.F. book description.

00:27.750 --> 00:35.140
Now what we're going to put in is her name so of her name and then we're going to have a default value

00:35.140 --> 00:42.300
here book type equals nonfiction

00:44.950 --> 00:45.340
OK.

00:45.350 --> 00:46.080
So there we go.

00:46.090 --> 00:54.310
Nothing to drastically new there no open air quotes display book information

00:57.950 --> 00:59.510
closer quotes.

00:59.600 --> 01:14.610
And as always print OpenTable double quote backslash newline this book is a closer quote Plus book type

01:16.080 --> 01:19.680
plus full stop OK.

01:19.770 --> 01:31.850
Next print the author of this book is closer quote.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.190
Plus her name

01:37.310 --> 01:39.050
OK and I've made a typo.

01:39.090 --> 01:40.000
Here's what you can see.

01:40.010 --> 01:46.260
I've mistype my e and names just changed us and change it here so we don't have any conflict errors.

01:46.310 --> 01:51.620
Often name named title brackets close or break and plus

01:54.910 --> 01:55.850
full stop.

01:56.230 --> 01:58.930
OK now onto the interesting part.

01:58.960 --> 02:02.080
Our function call so Book Description.

02:02.080 --> 02:09.530
Nothing new here and our author is Ashley Vance.

02:10.210 --> 02:17.530
OK so I'm only putting in one argument here because back in our function description we set a default

02:17.530 --> 02:24.540
value of book type nonfiction so we don't need to pass the argument from a function call of book type.

02:24.540 --> 02:27.930
That's Rundell all error.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.210
What did we get.

02:29.260 --> 02:30.820
Line 11.

02:30.820 --> 02:32.440
Here we are instead of putting in a full stop.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.450
I put it in a comma.

02:33.460 --> 02:34.050
There we go.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.840
OK so let's run this again.

02:36.340 --> 02:37.110
There we go.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.260
This book is nonfiction.

02:38.260 --> 02:40.270
The author of this book is Ashlee Vance.

02:40.330 --> 02:46.270
So as you can see because we put in a default value in our parameters book type we don't need to mention

02:46.270 --> 02:49.060
book type in our function called down here.

02:49.120 --> 02:54.420
Also another important thing to note here is that we have changed the order of the parameters.

02:54.430 --> 03:00.790
This is because default values makes it necessary to specify a type of book as an argument.

03:00.790 --> 03:03.840
The only argument left in the function call is the author's name.

03:03.870 --> 03:06.650
Python still interprets this as a position argument.

03:06.820 --> 03:11.500
So if the function is called which is an author's name the argument will match up with the first parameter

03:11.560 --> 03:13.870
listed in the function's definition.

03:13.870 --> 03:17.810
This is the reason the first primary needs to be alternate.

03:17.810 --> 03:21.280
The simplest way to use this function is provide just an author's name and a function call which you've

03:21.280 --> 03:22.430
just done.

03:22.450 --> 03:25.290
Actually that's how we go.

03:25.430 --> 03:30.510
If we wanted to override our default value of nonfiction for pop type we could do the following into

03:30.510 --> 03:33.380
our function call and are in a new argument.

03:33.410 --> 03:40.380
So actually events come up book type equals fiction.

03:41.150 --> 03:42.110
So let's see now.

03:42.110 --> 03:47.680
So as you can see I'd be wrong that this book this book is a fiction book.

03:47.810 --> 03:51.680
I need to tidy that up so what I'm going to do now here is just correct that this is a

03:55.410 --> 03:56.760
fiction.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.270
There we go.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.380
Let's run it again.

03:58.770 --> 04:03.840
This is a fiction and I should say book they're not fiction fiction book.

04:03.840 --> 04:04.230
There we go.

04:04.230 --> 04:05.910
It is a fiction book.

04:05.970 --> 04:07.680
The author of this book is actually Vantz.

04:07.800 --> 04:13.500
So as you can see here by entering in an argument book type equals fiction we override our parameters

04:13.500 --> 04:15.430
default value.

04:15.620 --> 04:16.900
So I hope you found that useful.

04:16.940 --> 04:20.080
And as always if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
