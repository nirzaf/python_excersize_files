Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.710 --> 00:06.150
Now in this lecture we're going to be looking at returning a value so a function doesn't always have

00:06.150 --> 00:07.750
to display its output directly.

00:07.950 --> 00:13.050
Instead it can process some data and return a value or a set of values the value to a function returns

00:13.130 --> 00:14.910
is called the return value.

00:14.910 --> 00:19.500
The return statement takes a value from inside a function and sends it back to the line to call the

00:19.500 --> 00:20.530
function.

00:20.530 --> 00:23.840
So let's take a look in the example and let's start off with something simple.

00:23.970 --> 00:26.050
Let's format a name.

00:26.340 --> 00:34.110
So as always I've opened up with some comments and let's define our function so formatted name.

00:34.110 --> 00:35.700
That's our function name.

00:35.700 --> 00:41.030
So what do we have we have our first name and we have our last name.

00:41.710 --> 00:43.860
OK and there we go.

00:44.220 --> 00:47.240
Then we describe our function with our three quotes.

00:47.240 --> 00:47.850
Return

00:51.720 --> 00:58.180
return a formatted name close with quotes.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.480
OK so what this is going to be it's gonna become a fun name.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.400
So full name equals.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.820
And what's it gonna be.

01:04.840 --> 01:13.030
It's going made up our first name plus a space Don't forget you have to add into space and our last

01:13.030 --> 01:13.670
name.

01:14.120 --> 01:24.000
OK and when we wanted to return full name we want to make sure that everything is properly uppercase.

01:24.170 --> 01:25.540
Let's work on calling this now.

01:25.550 --> 01:35.020
So let's say a teacher which is myself I suppose equals formatted name I want to format that and let's

01:35.030 --> 01:38.610
give it two values Tony and start.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.640
Obviously this can be your name.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.510
Print teacher.

01:45.510 --> 01:46.180
There we go.

01:46.220 --> 01:48.440
Let's call that now and see what we get.

01:50.800 --> 01:51.380
Error.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.190
Why.

01:52.380 --> 01:55.290
Well that is because I misspelt return which is appalling.

01:55.310 --> 01:56.260
Apologies for that.

01:56.510 --> 01:57.880
So let's run it again.

01:58.460 --> 01:59.350
And there we go.

01:59.460 --> 02:03.000
A nice clean formatted output of a name.

02:03.050 --> 02:08.150
So what you can imagine this is a application so an online form or signing a web app or whatever it

02:08.140 --> 02:10.420
might be and the user when the entry into name.

02:10.460 --> 02:15.500
We don't know if you're going to Andrine Tony uppercase lowercase Staunton or briquets lowercase.

02:15.530 --> 02:20.170
What this does is it ensures that the output is the same formatted way each time.

02:20.300 --> 02:25.130
Let's look at another example and let's look at a user name.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.480
So let's have a look here.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.640
So again we start off defining our function.

02:28.640 --> 02:29.960
Get formatted

02:33.530 --> 02:40.100
username OK and as username is going to be somebody's email address or entity or SS email address.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.190
OK.

02:41.840 --> 02:50.840
And as always with our quotes return a formatted username.

02:50.850 --> 02:53.150
Here we go closer quote.

02:53.360 --> 03:03.360
So a user name equals email address dot strip and if you remember district when you use a string strips

03:03.370 --> 03:09.280
out all the whitespace or somebody puts in whitespace before or after your email address.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.360
Obviously that's not going to work.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.680
This will strip out any error like that.

03:12.790 --> 03:26.460
So return username than user equals get formatted username and let's give it Tony an example.

03:26.990 --> 03:28.200
Dotcom.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.310
And don't forget you need to enclose this in quotes.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.420
Let me just do that now.

03:31.420 --> 03:35.280
Quote And let's just add in some whitespace here.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.050
So let's just add and there we go.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.850
Print user.

03:41.020 --> 03:47.030
OK now if it doesn't work we should have a big chunk of whitespace to the right of our email address

03:47.110 --> 03:49.420
that runs.

03:49.510 --> 03:50.110
There we go.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.870
No whitespace here.

03:51.890 --> 03:53.730
Very very nice.

03:53.780 --> 03:59.860
So that's how again you can clean up user input related to an email address or a username.

04:00.060 --> 04:01.200
So I hope that makes sense.

04:01.290 --> 04:05.580
Thanks for listening and as always if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me and

04:05.580 --> 04:06.800
I'll see you in the next lecture.
