00:00.510 --> 00:04.930
Hi everybody and welcome back this lecture we're going to look at making arguments optional.

00:04.970 --> 00:07.060
So so far we've all been required.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.910
We're going to look now at making them optional.

00:09.090 --> 00:11.070
So let's take a look and jump right in.

00:11.070 --> 00:16.610
So as you can see I've amended my commentary making arguments optional so sometimes can make sense and

00:16.610 --> 00:21.030
make an argument optional so that people using the function can choose to provide extra information

00:21.120 --> 00:25.300
only if they want to we can use default values to make an argument optional.

00:25.620 --> 00:29.070
Let's update our get formatted name to include a middle name.

00:29.070 --> 00:29.710
So let's go.

00:29.710 --> 00:35.260
So def format a name.

00:36.070 --> 00:44.410
And so as we had previously first name middle name and now last name.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.310
So just one update there.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.730
Don't forget your colon and our quotes

00:52.230 --> 00:54.150
return a full name.

00:55.820 --> 01:05.830
So full name equals first name plus space plus middle name

01:09.430 --> 01:13.420
plus space plus last name

01:16.340 --> 01:23.830
and their return and spell it correctly this time not like our last lecture return phone name title

01:26.420 --> 01:27.080
OK.

01:28.870 --> 01:30.030
It's like we didn't the last one.

01:30.060 --> 01:36.390
Teacher equals formatted name Tony

01:40.060 --> 01:45.320
James which is my middle name name of my grandad started.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.430
OK.

01:47.590 --> 01:50.990
Print teacher.

01:52.020 --> 01:53.530
Let's run us.

01:53.650 --> 01:54.300
There we go.

01:54.310 --> 02:00.610
Tony James Dandan neatly and cleanly formatted that this function can handle the first middle and last

02:00.610 --> 02:01.360
name.

02:01.360 --> 02:05.590
However middle names are not always needed and as this function is at the moment it would not work if

02:05.590 --> 02:08.600
you try to use it without a middle name to make the middle name.

02:08.600 --> 02:13.360
Option B can give the middle name argument an empty default value and ignore the argument unless it

02:13.360 --> 02:19.500
is provided with a value the next code example we set the default value of a name to an empty string

02:19.740 --> 02:21.800
and move it to the end of the list of parameters.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.180
So let's have a look at exactly how we do it.

02:24.750 --> 02:28.670
Well let's take this much code here so delete does.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.100
So we're starting just the need to comment again.

02:31.410 --> 02:31.830
Let's go.

02:31.830 --> 02:37.500
So if middle name so if we got a middle name well then fullname

02:40.520 --> 02:48.740
will be first name plus space plus middle name

02:51.650 --> 02:55.400
space plus last name.

02:58.120 --> 03:13.530
Otherwise else our full name is going to be first name plus space plus last name and then a return value

03:13.530 --> 03:18.640
is going to be return phone name that title.

03:18.690 --> 03:21.590
So right away we can handle it with or without a middle name.

03:21.840 --> 03:25.620
OK now let's call our formatted names so teacher.

03:25.650 --> 03:26.520
Just like last one.

03:26.570 --> 03:28.820
Format a name.

03:29.160 --> 03:36.630
So it's going to have Tony as a first name Staunton as a second name and know the word Name the middle

03:36.630 --> 03:37.330
name sorry.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.470
Well that's going to be James just like the last example.

03:39.480 --> 03:44.670
But before we put that in we need make a change in the parameters of our function so we need to just

03:44.670 --> 03:46.410
remove the middle name from here.

03:46.520 --> 03:54.160
So let me just command an X that and now we need to put it in here and explain why now in a moment and

03:54.160 --> 03:56.770
what we need to do is because middle name is optional.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.850
We now need to give that an empty string.

04:00.820 --> 04:02.180
And that's it don't now.

04:02.320 --> 04:07.390
So middle name now its default value is an empty string so it's not provided for middle name but just

04:07.390 --> 04:08.620
take an empty string value.

04:10.060 --> 04:15.520
Here we finish this off with James and that's the middle name.

04:18.080 --> 04:23.380
Now and the reason we've changed the order of these is because middle name may not often be provided.

04:23.450 --> 04:25.040
Some users may or may not provide it.

04:25.210 --> 04:29.450
And because of that we moved at the end of our function called the end of our arguments in our function

04:29.450 --> 04:30.380
call.

04:31.010 --> 04:35.770
OK so let's print teacher and let's see what we got.

04:35.780 --> 04:36.530
There we go.

04:36.530 --> 04:37.930
Tony James Staunton.

04:38.270 --> 04:43.740
So Tony Stanton James so reordered into first name middle name last name.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.400
OK so far so good.

04:45.530 --> 04:53.690
So what happens when we don't have a middle name teacher equals former name.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.440
Tony stander.

04:57.650 --> 04:58.120
Here we go.

04:58.130 --> 05:04.070
Let's see what that gives us like gives us an error because I am too ahead of myself and I forgot my

05:04.070 --> 05:05.140
print statement.

05:05.390 --> 05:06.990
And let's see what that gives us.

05:08.080 --> 05:08.900
There we go.

05:08.950 --> 05:14.560
Our second one here Tony Standen so we don't have to put an ad middle name the middle name is now a

05:14.560 --> 05:17.120
default option for a user.

05:17.120 --> 05:22.090
Optional values allow function to handle a wide range of user cases while letting function calls remain

05:22.150 --> 05:24.160
as simple as possible.

05:24.220 --> 05:25.630
So I hope all that made sense.

05:25.630 --> 05:30.010
As always if you have any questions please not hesitate to contact me and I'll see you in the next lecture.

05:30.010 --> 05:30.330
Thank you.
