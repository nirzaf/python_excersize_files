Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.640 --> 00:06.910
Did you know that functions can alter return lists and dictionaries.

00:06.910 --> 00:07.780
No you didn't.

00:07.930 --> 00:10.280
Well let's explain how you can do that.

00:10.450 --> 00:11.900
Let's look at a new example.

00:12.100 --> 00:16.590
So as always let's start off with our comments.

00:16.810 --> 00:23.630
Today's date the 7th of the 11th 2016 which just happens to be my birthday.

00:23.650 --> 00:26.540
Thank you very much.

00:26.560 --> 00:34.420
And what better way to spend my birthday than teaching you guys returning a dictionary.

00:35.310 --> 00:36.500
OK.

00:37.090 --> 00:38.050
So let's have a look.

00:38.170 --> 00:40.410
Let's create a new function.

00:40.410 --> 00:42.620
Build a book.

00:42.760 --> 00:48.490
OK you should come as no surprise that our program our example program and this lecture is involving

00:48.520 --> 00:49.220
a book.

00:49.330 --> 00:52.240
So that's how the book name.

00:52.460 --> 00:57.540
That's the author of the publisher.

00:58.610 --> 01:11.660
OK don't forget your colon and don't open up at your comments create a dictionary of book information.

01:11.930 --> 01:12.650
OK.

01:12.660 --> 01:13.730
Those a comment.

01:14.060 --> 01:16.470
So book equals.

01:16.750 --> 01:20.930
Here we open our dictionary so we have name

01:24.350 --> 01:27.250
and again don't forget dictionaries are key value pairs.

01:27.410 --> 01:31.610
So we have the K name and then the value will be name.

01:31.610 --> 01:32.210
Here we go.

01:32.240 --> 01:38.280
Separated with a comma as all dictionary key value pairs are then we have an alter

01:40.850 --> 01:43.280
and that will be our order.

01:43.700 --> 01:44.480
Perfect.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.000
So far so good comma.

01:47.170 --> 01:48.370
Then we have our publisher

01:52.370 --> 01:54.310
colon publisher.

01:55.270 --> 01:57.060
OK so you can see what I'm doing here.

01:57.070 --> 02:04.120
And then we have return.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.970
Now what exactly this can do for us.

02:05.970 --> 02:12.770
Well if we say my book is called Build a book.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.640
OK so what are we doing here.

02:15.780 --> 02:18.360
We're adding values into our book function.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.590
So let's go.

02:19.590 --> 02:20.360
Name of the book.

02:20.370 --> 02:20.900
Let's go.

02:20.910 --> 02:25.190
Elon Musk and sorry this has to be surrounded in quotes.

02:25.230 --> 02:26.100
Elon Musk

02:29.460 --> 02:31.830
The answer is actually Vance

02:39.260 --> 02:41.750
and the publisher is Vergine books.

02:44.010 --> 02:46.010
OK.

02:46.310 --> 02:52.740
I mean just take it out there for readability and then print my book and let's see what we get from

02:52.740 --> 02:57.640
dush we get an error of course we do of course you know line 11.

02:57.670 --> 03:00.160
That is an easy simple silly error.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.260
I'M SO EXCITED IT'S MY BIRTHDAY that I'm losing the run of myself here.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.230
So print my book.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.060
There we go.

03:08.210 --> 03:11.820
Actually Van's publisher version books name Elon Musk.

03:12.190 --> 03:18.540
So dysfunction Bill's book takes in the the name the author the publisher and it puts these values into

03:18.540 --> 03:19.470
a dictionary.

03:19.820 --> 03:24.210
This function takes in simple textual information and puts it into a more meaningful data structure

03:24.600 --> 03:29.370
so that you can work with that later on and do more than just printing it as we've done here.

03:29.370 --> 03:32.400
We could easily extend this function to accept other values about a book.

03:32.580 --> 03:38.120
Even the book's content its summary ratings whatever might be in the in the dictionary here.

03:38.190 --> 03:39.300
So I hope that made sense.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.240
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
