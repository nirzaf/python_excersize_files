Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.110 --> 00:06.990
Now we're moving into a new section and it's time to talk about object our entailed program.

00:07.180 --> 00:13.750
So this section is called classes object orientated program is one of the most effective ways of writing

00:13.750 --> 00:16.750
software in Object orientation program.

00:16.750 --> 00:22.930
You write classes that represent real world things and situations and create objects based on those

00:22.930 --> 00:24.080
classes.

00:24.220 --> 00:29.970
When you write a class you're defining the general behavior that whole category of objects can have.

00:30.010 --> 00:35.260
Then when you create individual objects from the class each of those objects is automatically equipped

00:35.320 --> 00:40.180
with the general behavior you have given each object so prepare to be amazed.

00:40.390 --> 00:46.230
Making an object from a class is called instantiation and you work with instances of a class.

00:46.270 --> 00:50.010
This section will write classes and create instances of those classes.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.400
You can model almost anything using classes.

00:52.480 --> 00:58.570
And let's start simple by writing a book class which obviously represents a book not one book in particular

00:58.600 --> 01:01.780
but any book on what we know about most books.

01:01.960 --> 01:02.730
Well they have a name.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.530
They have a price and a publisher.

01:04.540 --> 01:08.720
We also know that most books are either hard or soft cover or e-books.

01:09.010 --> 01:12.760
These piece of information and behaviors will go into our book class because they're common to most

01:12.760 --> 01:13.780
books.

01:13.780 --> 01:19.090
This class will tell Spuyten how to make an object representing a book after a class is written.

01:19.180 --> 01:23.220
We'll use it to make individual instances each representing one specific book.

01:24.100 --> 01:24.930
Are you excited.

01:24.940 --> 01:26.540
I hope so because I am.

01:26.680 --> 01:30.100
Let's get started and create our first class the book Class.
