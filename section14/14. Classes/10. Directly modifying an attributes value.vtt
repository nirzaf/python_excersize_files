Hi everybody welcome back in this lecture and the next few to follow.

00:03.780 --> 00:09.230
We're going to look at how to modify attribute values under several ways to change attribute values.

00:09.420 --> 00:12.270
First you can change the value directly to an instance.

00:12.270 --> 00:16.570
Then you can set the value to a method or you can increment the value to a method.

00:16.770 --> 00:18.470
Let's look at each one of these in turn.

00:18.690 --> 00:22.490
And in this lecture we're going to start off with modifying and attribute value directly.

00:22.550 --> 00:27.810
So as you can see here I have the same class open from our last lecture and goes gonna change our name

00:27.810 --> 00:32.910
for a program here from setting a default value which it was in our last letter to modifying

00:35.480 --> 00:36.680
and attributes

00:39.400 --> 00:43.810
value directly.

00:44.020 --> 00:44.930
And how do we do that.

00:45.130 --> 00:50.680
Well modifying an attribute value directly is the simplest way to modify the value of an attribute because

00:50.680 --> 00:53.730
we can access the attribute directly to an instance.

00:54.130 --> 00:57.280
In this latter we are going to set our library count to a new value.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.550
So let's just say we're set it to 36.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.590
So we have 26 e-books in our library.

01:01.610 --> 01:02.730
And how do we do that.

01:03.040 --> 01:07.060
So what we do is we scroll down to the bottom and let's just add in a space here because this is the

01:07.060 --> 01:08.510
part we're going to modify.

01:08.800 --> 01:15.630
So my new e-reader don't read library count brackets so let's just change just now we're going to do

01:15.670 --> 01:21.320
is my new e-reader So library count equals 36.

01:21.380 --> 01:28.180
They're going to say my new e-reader that color method again we live we can't.

01:28.180 --> 01:28.700
There we go.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.810
Let's run down and see what we've got.

01:30.820 --> 01:33.460
You have 36 books in your Kindle library.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.080
OK.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.190
So line 29 here.

01:37.220 --> 01:44.750
We use da notation to access the e-readers library count attribute and set add value directly.

01:44.750 --> 01:51.590
This line tells plotted to take the instance of my new e-reader find the attribute library account associated

01:51.590 --> 01:55.040
with it and set the value of that attribute to 36.

01:55.070 --> 01:59.060
Sometimes you'll want to use this direct method but there will be other times when you want to write

01:59.060 --> 02:00.990
a method that updates the value for you.

02:01.130 --> 02:03.270
And in the next lecture we're going to take a look at that.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.220
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
