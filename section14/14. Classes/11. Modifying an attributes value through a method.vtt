Hi everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to look at how to modify an attribute value

00:05.400 --> 00:11.870
to a method so we can have methods that update certain attributes for us instead of accessing the attributes

00:11.870 --> 00:17.060
that directly like we did in the last lecture we can pass the new value to a method that handles the

00:17.060 --> 00:18.420
updating inherently.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.970
So let's look another example.

00:20.150 --> 00:25.790
So as you can see I have my class e-reader here and I just remove the last few lines from The Last Lecture.

00:25.790 --> 00:31.790
So in this example we are going to modify our e-reader class with the addition of a new method and let's

00:31.790 --> 00:33.230
add that method now.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.700
So here we go.

00:37.010 --> 00:48.420
And it goes here the F I'm going to call this update library count so you can tell from our name.

00:48.570 --> 00:54.990
I'm going to have solve this is going to take a new parameter and we're going to call it book can't

00:55.080 --> 01:00.940
actually e-book can't because that's what it's doing counting our e-books for our library.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.990
Colin we have to give it a description.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.060
Set the library.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.150
And there we go.

01:10.690 --> 01:12.200
Now what we wanted to do.

01:12.220 --> 01:14.450
Well we wanted to take our library count.

01:14.560 --> 01:18.310
So self-taught library count.

01:18.760 --> 01:19.670
I'm going to give us.

01:19.780 --> 01:26.210
We're going to make it equal to or e-book count so how many e-books that we actually have now and how

01:26.210 --> 01:27.970
do we call this how do we make this work.

01:28.100 --> 01:38.220
Well we got to the end of our program and we say my new e-reader does updates library count and what

01:38.220 --> 01:39.690
value do we want to pass for a method.

01:39.690 --> 01:44.630
What we want to pass let's say 48 so we have 48 books we get 48 books are doing well.

01:44.670 --> 01:53.410
My new e-reader that and we want to call our previous method we just read library count read library

01:53.410 --> 01:54.870
count brackets.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.200
OK let's see what we get.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.010
There you go.

01:58.090 --> 02:00.490
You have 48 books in your library.

02:00.490 --> 02:06.730
So in this example we modify our e-reader class with the addition of update library count here.

02:06.790 --> 02:13.910
This method takes in AIM and the Count and stores it in self-taught library count at line 33.

02:14.200 --> 02:18.730
We call update library count and give it 48 as an argument.

02:18.730 --> 02:24.520
It sets the library count to 48 and read library count prints out the new reading.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.650
Hope that made sense.

02:25.660 --> 02:28.290
It's another simple way to modify an attribute value.

02:28.660 --> 02:29.380
Thank you for listening.

02:29.380 --> 02:33.350
And if any questions please do not hesitate to contact me and I'll see you in the next lecture.
