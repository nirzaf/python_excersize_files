Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.460 --> 00:06.690
Now this lecture got a look at how to increment the attributes value true method.

00:06.690 --> 00:10.830
So there will be times when you want to increment and attribute value by a certain amount rather than

00:10.830 --> 00:12.700
set an entirely new value.

00:13.680 --> 00:19.360
So let's say we have our e-reader and we're on the Amazon Web site and we buy a new e-book.

00:19.410 --> 00:24.260
So obviously our library count is going to go up by whatever number of books we've just bought.

00:24.270 --> 00:30.930
So we have 50 books on our e-reader and we buy one Democrat 51 books on an e-reader or 52 or 53 depending

00:30.930 --> 00:34.480
on how much or how many e-books we have just purchased.

00:34.650 --> 00:40.170
So let's now create a method that allows us to pass this incremental amount and add that value to our

00:40.170 --> 00:41.740
library count reading.

00:41.760 --> 00:42.850
So let's create a method now.

00:42.870 --> 00:51.330
So I have the code from our last lecture lecture in 93 I believe and let's say the F increment library

00:51.900 --> 00:59.230
count because that's what we're doing we're in incrementing the amount of books in our library and we

00:59.230 --> 01:05.230
have self as always we're going to be adding in a new primary here and that is going to be purchased

01:07.000 --> 01:10.730
e-books because that's what we're doing we're buying new e-books.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.190
Don't forget your code and like I just did.

01:13.210 --> 01:13.990
There we go.

01:14.200 --> 01:27.700
And our comment is that our new e-books e-books e-books to our library count that being how many books

01:27.700 --> 01:29.140
Kindle shows that we have.

01:29.280 --> 01:29.950
OK.

01:30.280 --> 01:35.860
So what we do here when we say self and it's our library count are modifying So library count.

01:35.860 --> 01:37.070
There we go.

01:37.470 --> 01:43.930
Equals sorry plus equals because we're incrementing purchased e-books.

01:43.930 --> 01:49.270
Now with that on what we do what we go down here and as we saw in the last lecture this piece of code

01:49.270 --> 01:52.200
here sets our library count to 48.

01:52.240 --> 01:58.150
So it means that Inari Kindle e-reader we have 48 books in our library but let's just say we just bought

01:58.360 --> 01:59.520
five new e-books.

01:59.530 --> 02:04.120
We can get a bit of a spending spree on Amazon and we just bought five new e-books.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.080
How do we increment that using the method that we just created.

02:07.150 --> 02:15.040
Well we'd say my new e-reader that increment so incremental library count and what we want to do what

02:15.040 --> 02:16.920
we want incremental by five.

02:17.920 --> 02:25.510
And then we want to put our new reed library count so my new e-reader same is just above that Reed library

02:25.510 --> 02:26.010
count.

02:26.050 --> 02:30.120
So nothing too new here brackets command and we run this.

02:30.130 --> 02:32.580
There we go.

02:32.780 --> 02:37.150
You have 48 books in your Kindle library which we did before we went on our spending spree.

02:37.370 --> 02:40.840
And now we have 50 tree books in our Kindle library.

02:40.880 --> 02:48.230
Now let's just recap our new method incremental library count and line tarty takes in a number of purchased

02:48.260 --> 02:53.830
e-books and adds this value to self-taught library count I'd line 24.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.220
As we've done all along.

02:55.490 --> 03:02.140
We create a new instance of my new e-reader and we set that value to line 40.

03:02.140 --> 03:08.380
We do an incremental library count and pass it the value 5.

03:08.550 --> 03:15.210
So that means now after spending spree we have fifty three e-books which we can see in our output.

03:15.210 --> 03:19.140
I hope that was easy and easy enough to understand and as always if you have any questions please do

03:19.140 --> 03:20.670
not hesitate to contact me.

03:20.670 --> 03:22.570
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
