00:00.420 --> 00:02.180
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.220 --> 00:07.820
Now once we have a class that inherits from a parent class like we just did in our last lecture we can

00:07.830 --> 00:13.680
at any new attributes and methods necessary to differentiate the child from the parent.

00:14.100 --> 00:22.020
Let's now add an attribute that is specific to kindle fire e-readers for example a color screen and

00:22.020 --> 00:24.640
then we will add a method to report on this attributes.

00:25.790 --> 00:30.200
We store to screen and write a method that prints a description of the screen.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.510
So let's go and do that now.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.000
So where do we start.

00:34.460 --> 00:39.740
Well let's start down here with our Kindle e-reader class so our child class and for us what we need

00:39.740 --> 00:42.790
to do is we need to add a new attribute.

00:43.280 --> 00:57.270
So in dev in a method that's out in screen resolution equals the screen resolution of a kindle fire

00:57.370 --> 01:02.460
when we're looking at anyway is 12 18 by seven by eight.

01:02.970 --> 01:03.450
There we go.

01:03.450 --> 01:04.590
Perfect.

01:04.590 --> 01:10.530
Now the next thing we want to do is we want to add in self variable the whole screen resolution.

01:10.530 --> 01:16.040
And we do that by entering into following Self touch screen resolution

01:18.450 --> 01:24.750
equals you guessed it screen resolution that's just separate out super matted pillows or superfunction

01:24.750 --> 01:25.510
bloat.

01:25.860 --> 01:28.150
OK that looks good.

01:28.150 --> 01:29.790
And now we want to create a method.

01:30.180 --> 01:31.150
So we go here.

01:31.350 --> 01:32.410
This is adding some space.

01:32.430 --> 01:33.840
So it's a little bit cleaner.

01:33.840 --> 01:45.510
We want to create a method so that describe screen and that takes a parameter self call.

01:45.610 --> 01:47.640
OK so what is this going to do.

01:47.680 --> 02:00.510
Well it's going to print out some marketing copy you know so just a marketing text about the Kindle

02:01.350 --> 02:02.380
Fire.

02:03.160 --> 02:10.350
OK to close that off now then we say print and way I get that a couple of paper print.

02:10.350 --> 02:12.730
Habit I suppose print.

02:13.150 --> 02:21.000
Now let's say Fire HD 8 and I get no royalties from Amazon for doing this.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.610
It's just that I have an e-reader So it's a handy example for a hasty eight features a wide screen

02:29.980 --> 02:31.750
and we want to close our brackets.

02:32.030 --> 02:33.500
Plus self

02:36.210 --> 02:39.960
screen resolution OK.

02:40.010 --> 02:46.860
Now let's just add in something simple at the end plus the screen.

02:47.420 --> 02:48.330
There we go.

02:48.470 --> 02:49.470
Full stop.

02:49.490 --> 02:50.880
OK.

02:51.230 --> 02:53.870
So that's what our method does going to print out this line here.

02:53.930 --> 02:55.310
Now how do we call this method.

02:55.310 --> 02:56.510
Well let's just clean this up a little bit.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.580
Take out a few of those blank lines.

02:58.680 --> 03:03.070
Now my Kindle Fire DOS.

03:03.200 --> 03:09.240
That's called a method the scribe screen brackets and fingers crossed.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.640
Error not a simple error there.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.600
No silly error.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.360
I indented too much.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.360
There we go

03:18.790 --> 03:19.790
that see.

03:19.940 --> 03:27.000
So we have our first description here so our long description name that we don't the previous lecture

03:27.270 --> 03:33.720
followed by fire Hastey 8 features a wide screen 12 8 by a hundred hates the screen and let's just put

03:33.720 --> 03:37.050
in a new line here just to separate it out a little bit.

03:37.170 --> 03:37.920
There we go.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.220
That's nice and clean.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.320
Let's run through what we just did.

03:41.450 --> 03:47.930
At 9:37 we added a new attribute screen resolution ECOs 12 eighty eight hundred.

03:48.330 --> 03:54.510
This attribute will be associated with all instances created from the Kindle Fire class but won't be

03:54.510 --> 03:57.970
associated with any instances of e-reader.

03:58.110 --> 04:03.060
So it's only associated with the Kindle Fire class so very handy separating out different functions.

04:03.060 --> 04:06.900
There are different features and then that line 44.

04:07.170 --> 04:13.890
We added a method called describe screen that prints information about our screen when we call this

04:13.890 --> 04:14.210
method.

04:14.230 --> 04:18.690
We get a description that is clearly specific to the Kindle Fire screen.

04:18.690 --> 04:23.910
What's great about a child class Kindle Fire is that there is no limit to how much we can specialize

04:23.910 --> 04:28.710
and customize it to the Kindle Fire and differentiated from its parent.

04:28.740 --> 04:30.790
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
