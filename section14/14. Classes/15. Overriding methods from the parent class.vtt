Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.710 --> 00:05.920
Now this quick lecture we're gonna discuss how to override methods from the parent class.

00:05.970 --> 00:09.960
So we're not really going to code in this lecture we're just going to write out a couple of small samples

00:09.960 --> 00:15.510
of code so we can override any method from our parent class that doesn't fit in with what we're trying

00:15.510 --> 00:18.110
to model with the child class to do this.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.980
We define a method in the child class with the same name as the method we want to override from the

00:22.980 --> 00:24.030
parent class.

00:24.090 --> 00:28.860
This way pite in this regard the parent class method and only pay attention to the method we defined

00:28.890 --> 00:30.430
in the child class.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.870
So let's say our class e-reader has the following method.

00:34.890 --> 00:41.930
So let's just say DPF and describe backlights

00:44.800 --> 00:45.820
OK.

00:45.940 --> 00:55.410
That would have something like uterus to colon and then our comments would be describes the backlights

00:59.460 --> 01:04.420
of our e-reader that we go print

01:08.840 --> 01:20.110
the backlight of this of this e-reader allows you to read in the dark.

01:20.470 --> 01:21.790
OK.

01:23.080 --> 01:27.210
So we know what that does that that's what this is an imaginary method in our e-reader class.

01:27.370 --> 01:33.400
So this method at the moment is meaningless and it is also mean for Kindle Fire e-reader because that

01:33.400 --> 01:35.400
has a color screen it doesn't need a backlight.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.480
So how would we overwrite that.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.810
Well let's imagine as I said this is an e-reader class.

01:41.170 --> 01:47.140
And now let's imagine that the next method that we're going to write is in our Kindle Fire class and

01:47.140 --> 01:48.880
we will do this.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.920
The Describe

01:54.750 --> 01:55.380
backlights

02:01.380 --> 02:01.890
Comins

02:04.590 --> 02:11.370
the Kindle Fire does not have a backlight.

02:11.890 --> 02:14.770
OK those are comments as always then print

02:17.850 --> 02:27.550
the color screen lets you read in the dark.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.600
OK so what does all of this mean.

02:31.960 --> 02:36.070
When you use inheritance you can make your char classes retain what you need and override anything you

02:36.070 --> 02:37.920
don't need from the parent class.

02:37.930 --> 02:43.780
So as we just said at the start of this lecture if this method here was in our e-reader class describing

02:43.780 --> 02:50.510
the backlight of a normal e-reader we would not need this method in our Kindle Fire class and we could

02:50.530 --> 02:53.400
override that by using the same method name.

02:53.440 --> 02:58.120
And this way pikeman disregard the parent class method and only pay attention to the method we defined

02:58.150 --> 02:59.450
in the char class.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.410
Hope that was helpful.

03:00.490 --> 03:02.620
Thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
