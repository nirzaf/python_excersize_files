Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:03.090 --> 00:07.950
Now as we add more and more functionality to our classes our files can get very long.

00:08.040 --> 00:13.770
We're want to keep our files clean and tidy as possible to help with this pile and let us store classes

00:13.770 --> 00:17.960
in modules and then import the classes we need into our main program.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.780
So let's look at how we do that now.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.620
Well let's create a module containing just our e-reader class.

00:23.880 --> 00:30.360
So as you can see on the right hand side here I've copied and pasted in just my e-reader class so nothing

00:30.360 --> 00:31.050
else.

00:31.140 --> 00:35.720
My e-reader class Plus it's one two three four five methods.

00:35.730 --> 00:36.770
No print statements.

00:36.780 --> 00:39.880
No new variables no new instances nothing like that.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.330
Just my e-reader class and you can see here at the top.

00:43.440 --> 00:49.020
I've put in a common docstring which just describes the module and this module is a class that represents

00:49.080 --> 00:50.420
a basic e-reader.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.050
So this is not a million miles away from what we did or a functions in our last section.

00:55.080 --> 01:00.870
Now as I've done that here on the right hand side on the left hand side I've created a new file called

01:01.110 --> 01:03.670
my underscore e-reader.

01:03.850 --> 01:10.040
And as before make sure both your files as you can see in my left hand file menu here are in the same

01:10.220 --> 01:11.640
directory.

01:11.660 --> 01:14.050
Otherwise what we're about to do will not work.

01:14.060 --> 01:22.460
So what we do well to import our e-reader class into a separate file we write from lecture which is

01:22.460 --> 01:30.470
name my files your file may be different lecturn 98 so from file lecturn 98 import e-reader and your

01:30.470 --> 01:35.310
e-reader class is going to have a couple whatever it is in this instance is capital E..

01:35.900 --> 01:41.930
Now as you can see here we have no new variables created for new e-reader like we did in a previous

01:41.930 --> 01:43.640
lecture and we've no print statement.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.700
So we simply need to do that here.

01:45.950 --> 01:50.670
So my new e-reader and we did this before.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.900
So there's nothing new here.

01:51.920 --> 01:59.480
My new e-reader equals e-reader So we're calling our class and now we put in the features or the description

01:59.720 --> 02:00.950
that we had in a previous lecture.

02:00.950 --> 02:05.320
So it's an Amazon Kindle.

02:05.530 --> 02:09.130
That's the make model is Paperwhite

02:11.930 --> 02:17.280
name I have difficulty pronouncing it's backlight so we're just going to say it as we did before just

02:17.280 --> 02:31.010
of all don't forget are opening quote backlights which is an excellent feature just for backlights several

02:32.480 --> 02:37.620
months of battery life.

02:38.060 --> 02:43.540
And then finally I screen type where we trained with the API.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.300
OK.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.090
So nothing new there.

02:46.520 --> 02:55.370
Then we have Prince my new e-reader and we're going to call the method get e-reader name over here.

02:55.480 --> 03:02.340
So does get the reader name.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.190
There we go.

03:03.420 --> 03:09.270
So this is just as if we were writing at the end of our class down here on the bottom right hand side.

03:09.750 --> 03:18.220
Let's just run this when you get an error on line for when we get an error because get the reader name.

03:18.420 --> 03:23.980
I didn't put in the full method name there and I put a new name.

03:24.000 --> 03:24.810
There we go.

03:25.020 --> 03:29.600
Amazon Kindle paperweight it just put back like seven months of battery life trade DPR.

03:30.240 --> 03:37.650
So what line one here we write our import statement which tells Platon to open the e-reader module and

03:37.650 --> 03:39.830
import the e-reader class.

03:39.870 --> 03:46.230
Now we can use the e-reader class as if it were defined in this file here importing classes is an effective

03:46.230 --> 03:49.470
way to program once your classes work as you want them to.

03:49.470 --> 03:53.810
You can leave those files alone and focus on higher level logic of your main programs.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.840
Thank you for listening and have any questions.

03:55.890 --> 03:58.670
Please do not hesitate to contact me and I'll see you in the next lecture.
