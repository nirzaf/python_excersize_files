Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.830 --> 00:06.810
Now in this lecture we're going to look at importing multiple classes from a module so we can import

00:06.840 --> 00:11.830
as many classes that we need into a program file if we want to make a regular e-reader.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.780
And then a Kindle Fire e-reader in the same file we need to import both classes e-reader and Kindle

00:18.780 --> 00:19.320
Fire.

00:19.350 --> 00:20.620
So let's do that now.

00:20.670 --> 00:25.530
So import Now as you can see on the right hand side I just have my program as we've done in the last

00:25.530 --> 00:32.070
couple of lectures all their so on the left hand side import from lecture 100.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.650
And I'm just incrementing these lectures as I go.

00:34.650 --> 00:40.130
The last one was 99 to before that 98 sorry and that should be from.

00:40.290 --> 00:44.460
So from lecture 100 hundred import now.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.850
So how do we import multiple classes.

00:46.860 --> 00:54.260
Well the reader is the first class we want to import come on Kindle Fire.

00:54.260 --> 00:58.230
So there are two classes now imported from lecture 100.

00:58.230 --> 01:06.360
Now how do we use the two classes where we say let's say my my black and white so my BW e-reader and

01:06.390 --> 01:09.680
that's what a Kindle Paperwhite e-reader is it's black and white.

01:09.800 --> 01:17.130
So my e-reader equals e-readers Let's call that class our first e-reader class or our main class.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.350
I suppose our parent.

01:18.510 --> 01:19.430
And then what do we have.

01:19.440 --> 01:28.400
Well let's make Amazon and my brackets want run way around as my ID has highlighted that its model is

01:28.400 --> 01:30.720
paper weight.

01:31.550 --> 01:39.500
Don't forget quote's paper weight backlight so it has a backlight so adjustable as we've seen previously

01:39.500 --> 01:45.280
adjustable back light next.

01:45.710 --> 01:51.280
And several months of battery life.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.570
There we go.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.520
And then it's screen type is tray hundred deep.

01:57.620 --> 01:58.650
There we go.

01:58.670 --> 02:05.530
Now how would we call this what we would say after I close my quote We would say

02:09.350 --> 02:23.200
my BW e-reader does get e-reader get underscore e-reader underscore name brackets that see what happens

02:23.200 --> 02:25.010
if we run this.

02:25.070 --> 02:25.610
There we go.

02:25.610 --> 02:29.170
Amazon paperweight just put back like seven months of battery life.

02:29.230 --> 02:32.810
Now let's call our Kindle Fire class.

02:33.010 --> 02:36.610
So my color e-reader

02:39.800 --> 02:49.630
equals Kindle Fire bracket's my make is Amazon same because these are from the same company.

02:49.650 --> 02:51.980
It's like different model phones or something like that.

02:52.110 --> 03:01.030
And this one is called a Kindle Fire Don't forget your quote Kindle Fire.

03:01.030 --> 03:03.240
There we go.

03:03.250 --> 03:11.360
Next it has a color the backlight has a color screen so we'll just leave that as color screen color

03:11.360 --> 03:14.420
screen.

03:14.700 --> 03:22.250
It's battery life is 12 hours so 12 hours of battery.

03:22.940 --> 03:28.710
And finally it's screen is 12:18 by 800.

03:29.480 --> 03:40.530
Now and again we call that we say print my color e-reader don't get e-reader name brackets.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.430
Let's run that and see what we got.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.320
Amazon Kindle Fire.

03:44.450 --> 03:45.310
Perfect.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.290
So we import most of our classes from a module.

03:47.290 --> 03:52.840
By separating each class with a comment once we've imported the necessary class we're free to make as

03:52.840 --> 03:55.450
many instances of each class as we need.

03:55.810 --> 03:57.680
So thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
