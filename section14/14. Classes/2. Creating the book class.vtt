00:00.390 --> 00:01.670
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.680 --> 00:07.120
Now as we just had an introduction lecture and the lecture we're going to be creating our book class.

00:07.370 --> 00:12.720
So each instance created from the book class will store and name a price and a publisher I don't have

00:12.720 --> 00:16.190
the ability to be a hardback soft black or an e-book.

00:16.310 --> 00:20.270
So let's look at creating the book class now like we did with our functions.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.720
We start off by defining our class.

00:22.890 --> 00:31.670
So instead of T.F. we have C L S S and the name of our class book two brackets colon.

00:32.230 --> 00:34.410
Now we put in our description

00:38.640 --> 00:43.680
class to create a book and we close the description and that's done in the same way that we did with

00:43.880 --> 00:45.160
functions.

00:45.180 --> 00:54.430
Next we have a function DPF So this is familiar to us all underscore underscore and I t underscore underscore.

00:54.450 --> 00:59.190
Now I'll explain more about this what this function is in just a short while.

00:59.190 --> 01:02.340
So what we put in next is our parameters self.

01:02.410 --> 01:06.810
Let's get back to that now and a second but we then we have the name of our book The Price of our book

01:09.170 --> 01:12.890
and the publisher OK.

01:13.220 --> 01:15.880
Don't forget our COLA.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.630
And again like when we were defining functions we have to put in a description

01:28.320 --> 01:32.040
here we have initialized the name price and publisher

01:34.860 --> 01:37.070
attributes.

01:37.110 --> 01:42.200
Now just follow along with me I'm going to explain everything in detail in just a few minutes.

01:42.240 --> 01:42.750
No.

01:42.760 --> 01:56.340
So self-taught name equals name self stock price equals price oh Slough self

01:59.060 --> 02:03.350
equals price self-taught publisher

02:06.030 --> 02:08.970
equals publisher.

02:08.970 --> 02:10.100
There we go.

02:10.150 --> 02:11.980
These actually just need to be indented.

02:12.030 --> 02:16.590
I don't know why they didn't indent after a function description but we indent them now just to make

02:16.590 --> 02:18.370
sure our program runs without error.

02:18.690 --> 02:30.820
Now next we create functions describe different parts of the book so we have hard back self Colan

02:35.280 --> 02:38.030
simulates a hard back

02:42.580 --> 02:51.370
ok print self name title or name in a book.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.640
Plus is a hardback

03:03.830 --> 03:08.650
and as always when we have comments when we have strings we need to put in quotes

03:12.590 --> 03:16.090
and we go now and get a function.

03:16.100 --> 03:21.390
So if back I was about to write software self back

03:26.500 --> 03:28.120
no simulate

03:32.380 --> 03:37.120
a book being a self back

03:43.200 --> 03:48.480
print self name title

03:51.600 --> 03:58.460
plus quotes is a self back book.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.890
And then finally we're going to have one more.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.430
And this is going to be our e-book book Self

04:09.910 --> 04:10.510
simulate

04:13.400 --> 04:14.610
an e-book.

04:15.110 --> 04:17.340
OK almost there.

04:17.410 --> 04:21.080
Now don't worry there's a lot of code here but don't worry we're going to go through it now in detail

04:21.310 --> 04:23.050
in just a few moments.

04:23.090 --> 04:23.720
Self-taught.

04:23.780 --> 04:29.820
Name that title plus

04:32.750 --> 04:34.930
is an e-book.

04:34.940 --> 04:39.800
OK now so like I just said there's a lot going on here but we've become very familiar with all of that

04:39.810 --> 04:41.180
by the end of this section.

04:41.270 --> 04:42.550
There was also some familiar parents.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.950
So don't be too scared and let's jump in.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.660
We start off by defining our class called book.

04:47.690 --> 04:53.240
So here we go at line 5 we define our class in pite and capitalize names refer to a class.

04:53.270 --> 04:58.490
So we capitalized the name book the brackets in the class definition are empty because we're creating

04:58.490 --> 05:00.130
this class from scratch.

05:00.380 --> 05:03.470
We then write a simple description of what the class does.

05:03.470 --> 05:09.590
So a class to create a book in the next lecture we're going describe I an I.T. method which is a special

05:09.590 --> 05:14.510
pipe method that runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on our pop class.

05:14.510 --> 05:15.530
So thanks for listening.

05:15.530 --> 05:19.510
I hope this wasn't too scary but stick with me and we'll get through this together.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.560
See you in the next lecture.
