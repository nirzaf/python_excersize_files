Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.210 --> 00:08.040
Now in this lecture we're going to look at how to import an entire module so we can import entire modules

00:08.090 --> 00:12.170
and then access the classes we need using dot notation.

00:12.170 --> 00:16.730
This approach is simple and results and code that it's easy to read because every call that creates

00:16.730 --> 00:19.490
an instance of a class includes the module name.

00:19.490 --> 00:23.560
This approach also has the benefit of avoiding naming conflicts would.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.420
And he would and he heard a name used in the current file.

00:26.510 --> 00:27.950
So here's how we do it.

00:27.950 --> 00:30.030
So I still have a file open from The Last Lecture.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.580
So I just take this one here.

00:31.670 --> 00:38.060
I just delete the second half of this line and I say instead of saying import or something from I say

00:38.060 --> 00:39.600
inport.

00:39.700 --> 00:48.160
Now what we want to do is we want to access the e-reader class and lecture 100 using duck notation lecture

00:48.180 --> 00:49.860
100 Dutch.

00:50.150 --> 00:55.850
Now we do the same here lecture one hundred does.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.530
OK seems simple enough.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.790
Let's see how it runs.

00:59.980 --> 01:02.630
It runs perfect.

01:02.730 --> 01:07.810
So you can see here at the first line we import the entire lecture 100 module.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.700
We don't use the module name followed by the class names.

01:10.710 --> 01:11.360
You can see it here.

01:11.370 --> 01:12.920
Mudgal name is lecture 100.

01:13.050 --> 01:13.800
E-reader.

01:13.980 --> 01:16.830
Module name one hundred Kindle Fire.

01:16.830 --> 01:18.470
I hope that was simple enough to understand.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.810
And as always if you have any questions please do not hesitate let me know.

01:21.810 --> 01:23.530
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
