Hi everybody and welcome back down this short lecture we're going to talk about how to import all classes

00:06.170 --> 00:13.160
from a module with a simple line of syntax so we can import every class from a module using the following

00:13.160 --> 00:13.980
syntax.

00:14.150 --> 00:23.140
So from lecture 100 import and then we have our X asterisked symbol.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.830
So you might remember it is from functions.

00:24.910 --> 00:30.760
What we just need to do with the program we create in the last lecture is remove lecture that 100 from

00:30.770 --> 00:32.200
our two instances.

00:32.230 --> 00:32.740
Here we go.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.650
That's done that's run.

00:35.000 --> 00:35.800
There we go.

00:35.810 --> 00:36.620
Simple enough.

00:36.710 --> 00:40.700
I don't really recommend this approach because when it comes to errors and troubleshooting you won't

00:40.700 --> 00:44.000
know which class is causing the error.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.800
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
