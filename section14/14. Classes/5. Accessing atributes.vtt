Hi everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to look at accessing attributes.

00:04.350 --> 00:08.100
But for us it's something that I want to do which I neglected to do in our last lecture that is add

00:08.100 --> 00:09.960
a comment to the code we added.

00:10.200 --> 00:17.420
So creating an instance of our book class.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.150
There we go.

00:19.180 --> 00:24.070
Make sure we know what we're doing at each step through this course to access the attributes of an instance.

00:24.180 --> 00:25.870
You use dot notation.

00:26.130 --> 00:27.450
So what does that look like.

00:27.450 --> 00:28.920
Well it looks like this.

00:28.920 --> 00:40.770
My book dush name or copy my book price price or publisher or any other attribute that we have.

00:40.770 --> 00:43.740
Now if we round up now nothing happens.

00:43.860 --> 00:48.500
So how do we put that into something that actually works and gives us information back.

00:48.580 --> 00:50.310
Well let's just remove that for the moment.

00:50.580 --> 01:02.020
So we say print and let's just say what are we doing we are reading so I'm I'm currently reading

01:04.890 --> 01:07.870
plus my book.

01:07.870 --> 01:16.870
Those are quotes first plus my book the name of the title.

01:17.010 --> 01:17.500
OK.

01:17.510 --> 01:22.170
And our brackets for a title plus full stop.

01:22.170 --> 01:25.110
Now let's see what that gives us.

01:25.110 --> 01:25.620
There we go.

01:25.620 --> 01:28.050
I'm currently reading Elon Musk.

01:28.050 --> 01:33.630
This syntax demonstrates how Python finds an attribute value pite and looks at the instance my book

01:33.840 --> 01:37.050
and then find the attribute name associated with my book.

01:37.050 --> 01:40.970
This is the same attribute referred to as self-taught name in the class book.

01:41.070 --> 01:45.690
So up here we have self-taught name self-doubt price self-doubt publisher so you can really see the

01:45.690 --> 01:48.210
power of classes starting to come out of neuron.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.680
We created one instance of a book and now we've used that instance here.

01:52.710 --> 01:58.220
My book name this could be my book Doc price lets out in another sentence.

01:58.220 --> 02:06.400
Print this book cost and let's leave a quote there.

02:06.400 --> 02:14.910
Plus my book price and because price is an integer we need to just first make this a string.

02:15.050 --> 02:22.050
So as or brackets plus full stop.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.890
There we go and close our brackets.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.360
Let's run this again.

02:25.680 --> 02:32.580
This book cost oh coast so where ever got that go wouldn't be it Tony program without a spelling error.

02:32.580 --> 02:38.360
This book costs fourteen point ninety nine and we can even put in a dollar sign here dollars.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.160
This book cost fourteen ninety nine dollars.

02:41.160 --> 02:41.610
There we go.

02:41.610 --> 02:47.320
So you can really see the power of the attribute coming out here when we're accessing them.

02:47.420 --> 02:51.320
Now in the next election we're going to look at how the a method and how we can give our class even

02:51.320 --> 02:53.550
more power and our programs even more power.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.530
So thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
