00:00.510 --> 00:01.770
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.770 --> 00:04.010
So as you can see here we're still in our book class.

00:04.140 --> 00:13.520
And again like I did in her lecture before going out and a quick comment here accessing attributes.

00:14.670 --> 00:15.340
No.

00:15.630 --> 00:18.410
So in this lecture we're going to look at calling methods.

00:18.510 --> 00:19.490
So what are our methods.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.140
Well these were methods here TGF sort of the same as functions but inside a class so any function inside

00:25.140 --> 00:27.450
a class is called a method.

00:27.450 --> 00:29.300
So at the moment we have four methods.

00:29.580 --> 00:32.810
The ones we're going to be calling our e-book self back right back.

00:32.820 --> 00:35.070
So let's look at how we do that now.

00:35.820 --> 00:41.310
So after we create an instance from a class book after we create an instance from our class book we

00:41.310 --> 00:44.850
can use that notation to call any method defined in book.

00:44.970 --> 00:49.400
So let's say does my book is a soft back.

00:49.530 --> 00:51.240
How do we do that.

00:51.340 --> 00:56.730
So if that's run that's nothing because I left the brackets.

00:56.730 --> 00:59.780
Now Elon Musk is a soft back book.

00:59.820 --> 01:01.870
Nice to call him method.

01:01.870 --> 01:06.610
Give the name of the instance in this case my book and the method you want to call separated by a touch

01:07.020 --> 01:13.620
when playing read my book Dorsch self back it looks for the method itself back in the class book and

01:13.620 --> 01:14.870
runs that code.

01:14.960 --> 01:19.460
The syntax is quite useful when attributes and methods have been given appropriate descriptive names

01:19.470 --> 01:20.450
like name price.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.380
Open close whatever it might be.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.040
We can easily infer what a block of code is supposed to do.

01:25.050 --> 01:27.240
Let's call another method here.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.190
So my book does hardback.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.530
Let's see what we got.

01:33.070 --> 01:36.610
My brackets again is a hardback book.

01:36.610 --> 01:42.730
OK so let's add another method so that C D F and isn't going to be related or ebox what we're going

01:42.730 --> 01:45.730
to say is e-book reader

01:48.440 --> 01:48.940
self

01:52.620 --> 01:54.250
and what we're going to say is for description.

01:54.250 --> 02:00.540
Simulate an ebook reader and is going to become useful later on.

02:00.540 --> 02:02.330
Now what does an ebook reader have.

02:02.340 --> 02:07.860
Well it has battery power it has a backlight it has a touch screen and has a lot of other functions

02:07.860 --> 02:10.560
that a normal book paper book doesn't have.

02:10.560 --> 02:16.250
So let's say we're reading the Eli must book print and let's say we have.

02:16.440 --> 02:22.100
So as we know in e-books we have a library so let's use Let's create a kind of a library listing here.

02:22.110 --> 02:25.570
So print library.

02:25.630 --> 02:27.180
There we go.

02:27.180 --> 02:39.010
And in our library we are going to have our name so that will be self name tough title.

02:39.060 --> 02:40.260
There we go.

02:40.260 --> 02:45.060
We're also going to have I forgot my plus symbol there so let's just put that in and in making this

02:45.060 --> 02:45.900
up as we go.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.540
So bear with me.

02:47.550 --> 02:48.630
So what else will our book have.

02:48.630 --> 02:52.620
Well it's going to have a price because as you know if you're looking down your Kindle or whatever e-book

02:52.620 --> 02:57.000
reader use in your library you have the name you have the price and you have the publisher.

02:57.000 --> 03:06.000
So plus self darte sell sell price.

03:06.210 --> 03:07.250
There we go.

03:07.310 --> 03:17.610
Price price plus self publisher publisher it to this title.

03:18.240 --> 03:18.860
OK.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.100
And then after this we just out in a full stop.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.600
Plus let's see what we get.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.230
There we go.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.590
Now let me just go back to the start of this line.

03:29.110 --> 03:30.690
E-book print library.

03:30.960 --> 03:31.600
OK.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.240
Now so let's remove all of our code here

03:41.420 --> 03:44.370
including accessing attributes because I'm not going to do that at the moment.

03:44.480 --> 03:50.600
Let's add in a new comment calling our e-book reader or e-book

03:53.260 --> 03:55.660
reader method.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.410
OK.

03:57.580 --> 04:00.070
So let's do that now.

04:00.100 --> 04:07.610
And how do we call it like we just seen we say my book does e-book reader brackets and let's see what

04:07.610 --> 04:09.250
we get in error.

04:09.260 --> 04:13.170
Of course we do because we have the price and that has to be a string.

04:13.310 --> 04:17.380
I should have known that I was thinking that as I wrote it but then I just lost my train of thought.

04:17.930 --> 04:19.430
OK let's run it again.

04:19.430 --> 04:20.330
There we go.

04:20.330 --> 04:20.890
Library.

04:20.960 --> 04:28.120
Elon Musk I've no space there because I have to add in my spaces plus space plus

04:31.180 --> 04:31.920
another space

04:38.010 --> 04:39.040
plus another space

04:42.170 --> 04:43.220
good learning curve.

04:43.340 --> 04:45.530
First of all there we go.

04:45.530 --> 04:47.110
Currently I'm so in my library.

04:47.120 --> 04:52.280
I have lived in Isla Musk forking 99 Virgin Books and what I could do here is I could put in comments

04:52.280 --> 04:55.650
I could clean this up a little bit if I wanted so I could do that here.

04:58.330 --> 04:59.790
I don't at start.

04:59.940 --> 05:05.660
Obviously I need it here after a name.

05:06.060 --> 05:06.850
There we go.

05:07.110 --> 05:09.730
Fourteen ninety nine.

05:09.740 --> 05:12.140
There we go and believe that.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.430
So let's say it's a little bit cleaner now.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.100
Ninety nine.

05:16.100 --> 05:22.540
You can put in our dollar sign as well if we wanted.

05:22.540 --> 05:23.300
There we go.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.790
So as you can see here the ebook reader method could come in very handy if we are creating a piece of

05:27.790 --> 05:34.720
software related to an ebook or if we were an Amazon kind of type of bookselling Web site where we can

05:34.720 --> 05:40.690
show the different types of books that we sell such as hardback self back or e-book we could call it

05:40.690 --> 05:44.920
different methods related to the different page that the user is viewing and all we would have to do

05:44.920 --> 05:47.260
is add in more methods.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.340
So you can see here now the power of our class.

05:50.410 --> 05:54.100
I hope you found it useful as always if you have any questions please reach out to me.

05:54.130 --> 05:55.720
If not I'll see you in the next lecture.

05:55.720 --> 05:56.240
Thank you.
