Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.220 --> 00:03.050
Now we're in our class.

00:03.060 --> 00:06.670
We can create as many instances as we want from our class.

00:06.780 --> 00:09.820
So let's create a second book called your book.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.280
So here we go.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.210
So your book

00:14.770 --> 00:22.210
equals book and let's give it some different names so let's say I'm it's the it's The Everything Store

00:22.800 --> 00:24.810
and I'm just looking for it now on my bookshelf.

00:25.040 --> 00:32.130
And OK here we go so we have The Everything Store.

00:32.270 --> 00:32.810
Here we go.

00:32.810 --> 00:33.920
There is its name.

00:33.930 --> 00:36.040
Then we have its price let's say 999

00:39.280 --> 00:40.870
that's an integer nine point nine.

00:40.870 --> 00:41.650
Sorry that's a float.

00:41.650 --> 00:45.980
Nine point nine nine because as a decimal place and then the publisher and I just just keep it in gonna

00:46.040 --> 00:48.370
say Virgen books because I can't remember who publishes it.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.980
And from that distance from my bookshelf I can see it.

00:51.220 --> 00:52.310
So there we go.

00:52.390 --> 00:55.230
We have created your book now.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.340
How do we call that.

00:56.510 --> 00:59.990
Well like we did previous lecture we just go back to calling our method.

00:59.990 --> 01:05.810
So your book and let's call it and let's say you're reading a hard back book.

01:05.960 --> 01:11.980
So your book does hardback brackets.

01:12.050 --> 01:12.820
There we go.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.760
The Everything Store is a hardback book.

01:16.040 --> 01:20.570
So even if we use the same name price and polish for the second book it will still create a separate

01:20.570 --> 01:22.030
instance from the book class.

01:22.220 --> 01:26.960
You can make as many instances from the one class you need as long as you give each instance a unique

01:27.020 --> 01:31.800
variable name or as long as it occupies a unique spot in a list or dictionary.

01:31.820 --> 01:36.790
So as you can see very easy to create instances and then very easy to call the methods for those interested

01:36.950 --> 01:38.040
within her code.

01:38.060 --> 01:39.850
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
