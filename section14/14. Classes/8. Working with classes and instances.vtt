00:00.900 --> 00:02.330
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.330 --> 00:06.660
Now with this lecture I'm going to create a brand new class called our e-reader class.

00:07.170 --> 00:08.460
So what does that involve.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.370
Well it involves creating a new class like we've done previously.

00:11.370 --> 00:12.650
It involves some functions.

00:12.650 --> 00:14.430
It evolves and parameters and attributes.

00:14.430 --> 00:16.610
Let's jump right in and get going.

00:16.740 --> 00:21.880
So let's start off by defining our class in our classes called e-reader brackets.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.150
Cool.

00:23.250 --> 00:31.230
Now we open this up for our comments my class to represent an e-reader

00:34.730 --> 00:42.940
where we go next we define our method underscore underscore I and I t underscore underscore.

00:43.240 --> 00:52.710
Now we have a parameter self make model as we know with e-readers or a number of different models.

00:52.810 --> 00:56.800
Does it have a backlights are putting it back like parameter.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.930
What's the battery life like.

00:57.940 --> 01:05.320
Sort of put that in as well and the screen type code are in there as well because now e-readers are

01:05.320 --> 01:08.150
not just black and white their color as well.

01:08.210 --> 01:09.420
And don't forget your colon.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.130
Next we put in a description.

01:11.410 --> 01:12.350
So initialize

01:15.220 --> 01:16.120
the attributes

01:19.150 --> 01:22.470
to describe an e-reader.

01:22.490 --> 01:27.820
Now we may we may not have captured all the attributes needed to describe any reader but we will look

01:27.820 --> 01:30.860
at that a little later.

01:31.000 --> 01:43.350
So as we saw in the previous lecture we start off with self does make equal make self does model equals

01:43.420 --> 01:51.420
model self dot backlight equals backlight

01:55.180 --> 02:00.050
that battery Eco's battery.

02:00.730 --> 02:07.490
And finally solve that screen type equals screen.

02:08.000 --> 02:08.600
There we go.

02:10.690 --> 02:11.470
Now what's next.

02:11.470 --> 02:18.120
Well next we're going to put in a function that will format are the output of our e-reader parameters.

02:18.130 --> 02:19.380
So let's have a look at how we do that.

02:19.420 --> 02:26.670
Well B.F. I'm going to call this gas e-reader name.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.850
There we go.

02:28.290 --> 02:31.080
We give that the parameter self call.

02:31.130 --> 02:32.810
Now a comment.

02:33.670 --> 02:39.560
So return a formatted script of

02:44.230 --> 02:51.070
name for our e-reader and if you think about it this would be something like if you're on Amazon buying

02:51.160 --> 02:55.780
an e-reader you would see a big head of head or descriptive name at the top of the page.

02:55.780 --> 03:01.810
So this could be dashed and it's called this long name because it is going to be a long name equals

03:02.470 --> 03:04.510
self does make.

03:04.760 --> 03:17.110
Let's start off with the make of our e-reader followed by quote's space plus Let's go to our model self-taught

03:17.230 --> 03:18.090
model.

03:21.130 --> 03:30.640
After that we have so many descriptive items in it so let's put in and the backlight self does back

03:30.640 --> 03:39.840
like plus space plus self Dazs battery

03:42.740 --> 03:48.140
plus putting in airspaces don't forget revisable come out nice and cleanly format.

03:48.460 --> 03:56.740
Plus screen type and just be spaced out there just for ease of use.

03:56.770 --> 04:01.250
Now we don't need a closing bracket or anything like that after that then we return.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.000
So what do we want to turn out.

04:03.100 --> 04:05.100
So we return our name

04:07.900 --> 04:11.660
that title so capitalized where necessary.

04:11.730 --> 04:15.700
Now let's call our new class and let's go.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.170
My so let's create a very.

04:17.180 --> 04:18.900
But my new e-reader.

04:19.020 --> 04:22.870
So we have a new e-reader you just ordered one from Amazon or wherever it is you shop.

04:23.130 --> 04:28.000
My new e-reader So here we are calling our class and let's give it the arguments that are passed into

04:28.030 --> 04:29.020
the parameters.

04:29.100 --> 04:34.730
So my new e-reader is an Amazon Kindle.

04:34.910 --> 04:35.390
OK.

04:35.410 --> 04:36.990
That's the make.

04:36.990 --> 04:37.870
What's the model.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.150
Well it's a paper wife.

04:39.180 --> 04:43.210
And if you want Amazon there are actually loads of different models so there's not just the one like

04:43.210 --> 04:52.270
there used to be there's a paper wice one back like well has an adjustable backlight.

04:52.610 --> 04:54.000
Have you read in the sun or in the dark.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.120
I suppose the battery while there's no kind of set time in the battery what it is is it's several months

05:00.860 --> 05:05.120
of battery life.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.030
OK.

05:06.650 --> 05:08.750
Then we have the screen types what kind of screen is.

05:08.770 --> 05:11.570
Well according to Amazon it straight home depot.

05:11.980 --> 05:13.810
There we go.

05:13.810 --> 05:21.520
And finally what we want to do what we want to print out is a variable that we just created my new e-reader

05:21.890 --> 05:26.890
want to invoke one of our method so get the reader name followed by brackets and that's it.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.450
So let's see what we have.

05:29.410 --> 05:30.280
We have an error.

05:30.310 --> 05:31.180
Why do we have an error.

05:31.180 --> 05:32.110
Let's have a look.

05:32.290 --> 05:38.020
Well we have an error because I didn't put self in front of screen type self that screen type.

05:38.020 --> 05:38.790
There we go.

05:39.010 --> 05:40.990
Let's run it again and see what we get.

05:40.990 --> 05:41.980
Perfect.

05:42.010 --> 05:44.530
So let's have a look at our output for a moment.

05:44.530 --> 05:48.960
Amazon Kindle Paperwhite It just bought back like several months of battery life on a deep drive.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.150
I'm sure we can clean that up just a little bit.

05:51.230 --> 05:52.880
So let's have a look at how we do that.

05:53.020 --> 05:57.550
Let's go back into our long name and let's start in a couple of hyphens.

05:59.900 --> 06:03.190
When I say a couple I mean several want to here

06:07.790 --> 06:11.260
and another one here.

06:11.260 --> 06:11.940
There we go.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.250
Let's run it again.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.210
OK.

06:14.230 --> 06:15.640
Little bit easier to read.

06:15.640 --> 06:21.180
Amazon Kindle Paperwhite just about back back like several months of battery life treatment to the API.

06:21.190 --> 06:27.040
Now it's not a very big stretch of imagination to see this on the Amazon web page so to click onto the

06:27.040 --> 06:31.900
image or the description of a Kindle and have this as your big headline at the top and then you follow

06:31.900 --> 06:34.440
it down to read people's reviews and things it does.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.830
So let's just go back to your class here and see what we have.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.700
OK let's start here.

06:39.810 --> 06:40.280
Line 8.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.770
We defined it in a method with the self parameter for us exactly like before.

06:43.760 --> 06:44.710
What about class.

06:44.830 --> 06:51.610
We also give it several parameters such as make model backlight battery screen type the init method

06:51.610 --> 06:55.660
takes in these parameters and stores them in attributes that would be associated with instances from

06:55.660 --> 06:56.860
this new class.

06:56.860 --> 07:02.890
When we make a new e-reader instance we will need to specify a make model backlight battery and screen

07:02.890 --> 07:03.160
type.

07:03.160 --> 07:12.850
For instance at line 16 here we define a method called Get e-reader name that puts on e-readers make

07:12.850 --> 07:19.420
model backlight battery screen type into one string neatly formatted for e-reader despairs from having

07:19.420 --> 07:23.230
to print each attribute value individually to work with the attribute value.

07:23.230 --> 07:28.300
In this method we use self-taught make self-taught model of self-taught back like self-taught battery

07:28.450 --> 07:31.410
self-taught screen type building on our last lectures.

07:31.420 --> 07:32.940
This is actually not that complicated.

07:32.950 --> 07:37.750
If you take it step by step piece by piece and this lecture now is all about bringing those pieces together

07:37.750 --> 07:39.940
into one class which we've just done.

07:39.940 --> 07:45.040
And then line 21 we make an instance from the e-reader class and stored in the variable.

07:45.040 --> 07:51.420
My new e-reader then we call get e-reader name to show what kind of e-reader we have.

07:52.830 --> 07:54.020
So hope all that made sense.

07:54.060 --> 07:55.800
If not please don't hesitate to ask me.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.530
And as always thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
