Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.620 --> 00:06.830
Now in this lecture we're going to be looking at how to set a default value for an attribute.

00:07.030 --> 00:12.700
So every attribute in a class needs an initial value even if that value is zero or an empty string.

00:12.970 --> 00:18.160
When setting a default value it makes sense to specify this initial value in the body of the init method.

00:18.490 --> 00:23.170
If we do this for an attribute we don't have to include a parameter for that attribute.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.470
So we are going to add in a default value for a new attribute here.

00:26.470 --> 00:30.810
So we're going to go self does and what is it going to be when going to be a library count.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.370
So this is going to count how many books we have in our the library.

00:34.390 --> 00:37.070
I'm going to set the default value of this to zero.

00:37.210 --> 00:40.380
And that makes sense because when you buy a new Kindle you're not going to have any books in it.

00:40.420 --> 00:44.710
So the initial amount of books in your Kindle library is going to be zero.

00:44.710 --> 00:49.840
And because we've done it here and we've set a default value to zero we don't have to put in a new parameter

00:50.050 --> 00:50.820
up here.

00:50.980 --> 00:56.750
So we just add in an attribute called Library count that always start with a value of zero.

00:56.770 --> 01:02.130
We're also adding Now a new method that helps us read each Kindles library count.

01:02.140 --> 01:04.830
So let's do that here Jeff.

01:04.900 --> 01:09.730
And let's call this reed library helpful if I spelt it right.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.660
Redelivery count OK.

01:16.220 --> 01:18.990
Colon and let's describe this method.

01:19.040 --> 01:30.970
So show the amount of e-books in our Kindle library every go close that.

01:31.010 --> 01:32.110
So what we wanted to show.

01:32.160 --> 01:37.680
Well if anybody is familiar with e-readers you know that under homescreen it'll say on this device or

01:37.680 --> 01:41.500
in this library are 20 books 50 books 101 books.

01:41.580 --> 01:46.560
But obviously as we have just created this e-reader the amount of books in the library is going to be

01:46.560 --> 01:48.510
zero.

01:48.630 --> 02:00.410
You have them we go plus now it's going to be a string because we're putting as self does library count

02:02.740 --> 02:03.800
plus.

02:03.850 --> 02:16.240
So you have there could be zero copy panicle be 20 books in your Kindle for Kindle library.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.290
There we go.

02:17.890 --> 02:19.650
So what we want to do now.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.810
Well now we have a lockdown here.

02:22.810 --> 02:28.080
We can leave as we have in our last lecture my new e-reader alone we can leave print my new e-reader

02:28.120 --> 02:33.610
get you either name or not we want to do is we want to again call our new e-reader.

02:33.610 --> 02:40.380
And we wanted to read our library count brackets that's around us and see what we got.

02:40.390 --> 02:41.270
There we go.

02:41.620 --> 02:47.500
So we have like from our last lecture our big descriptive name and then we have zero books in Arkana

02:47.560 --> 02:48.380
library.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.120
So we have zero books on that again.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.680
You have zero books and your Kindle library.

02:54.760 --> 02:59.140
So obviously as we download books that'll go to one two three four and we'll look at something about

02:59.140 --> 03:00.580
doing that later.

03:00.640 --> 03:06.240
So it can cause the end of matter to create a new instance it stores to make the model of the backlight

03:06.280 --> 03:11.170
the battery the screen type as attributes like it did in the previous example then pipe and create a

03:11.170 --> 03:14.490
new attribute called Library count which we have here.

03:15.530 --> 03:19.470
That line 15 and it set its initial value to zero.

03:19.470 --> 03:23.970
We also have a new method called Read library count at line 22.

03:23.970 --> 03:24.840
There we go.

03:24.870 --> 03:26.120
So I hope all that made sense.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.820
As always if you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me and I'll see you in the next

03:29.820 --> 03:30.330
lecture.

03:30.330 --> 03:30.680
Thank you.
