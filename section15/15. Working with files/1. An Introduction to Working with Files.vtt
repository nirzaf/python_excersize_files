Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.720 --> 00:08.330
Now we come an enormous way since we first fired up our pipeline ID or shell.

00:08.330 --> 00:12.470
I think if you look back now we've just completed 100 lectures so that is quite an accomplishment so

00:12.470 --> 00:14.440
well done on getting this far.

00:14.840 --> 00:19.820
Now it's time to take a learning and a program to another level in this section.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.440
We're moving into a new section.

00:21.650 --> 00:26.340
We're going to learn to work with files that our programs can quickly analyze lots of data.

00:26.630 --> 00:30.650
So this section is going to be of interest to pretty much everybody taking this course because we're

00:30.650 --> 00:32.890
going to start to get really interactive now.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.690
By learning to work with files and saving data our programs take on another dimension and become easier

00:38.690 --> 00:40.180
for people to use.

00:40.190 --> 00:47.360
There was so much information available in textfiles population news numbers whether property game results

00:47.490 --> 00:48.810
election results.

00:48.810 --> 00:53.210
Everything there's so much information out there and we're going to look at the Explorers and data sets

00:53.270 --> 00:54.620
as we move to that section.

00:55.630 --> 01:00.610
When we want to work with information in a text file the first step is to read the file into memory.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.320
We can read the entire contents of a file or we can work through a file one line at a time.

01:05.320 --> 01:09.580
Our first lecture is going to explore reading an entire file.

01:09.580 --> 01:11.470
So let's jump right in and get started.

01:11.470 --> 01:13.360
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
