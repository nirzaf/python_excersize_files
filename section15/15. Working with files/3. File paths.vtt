Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.010 --> 00:04.540
Now in this lecture we're going to be looking at file paths.

00:04.860 --> 00:10.650
So when we pass a simple fun name like movies RTX T to the open function pipe it looks in the directory

00:10.650 --> 00:15.570
where to find it's currently being executed is stored but this will not always be the case depending

00:15.570 --> 00:16.890
on how you organize your work.

00:16.890 --> 00:20.940
Sometimes the file you want to open may not be in the same directory as your program file.

00:21.030 --> 00:26.280
For example what in your working folder where you say reprogrammed you might have a note or folder called

00:26.330 --> 00:31.320
text files to store to text file and you're currently working with to get piped into open the files

00:31.320 --> 00:34.060
from a directory ordered under one where your program is stored.

00:34.110 --> 00:38.720
We need to provide a file path which tends to lock in a specific location on our system.

00:40.270 --> 00:45.550
If we create a new folder called text files within our working folder we would use a relative path to

00:45.550 --> 00:51.610
open a file with it around the file path tells it to look for a given location relative to the directory

00:51.760 --> 00:54.070
where the current program is stored.

00:54.070 --> 00:55.490
So what does this mean.

00:55.780 --> 01:01.630
Well as you can see on the left hand side here I have my working directory called files and then I have

01:01.630 --> 01:06.750
my movies dirty XTi I'm my movie reader which we worked with in the last lecture.

01:06.760 --> 01:11.500
Now I have a new program here called five parts which is the exact same as the last lecture except renamed

01:12.800 --> 01:15.880
also what in this folder files.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.050
I have another folder called textfiles.

01:18.460 --> 01:19.210
And went in there.

01:19.210 --> 01:21.950
I have a copy of moviestar XTi.

01:21.950 --> 01:26.850
And as you can see the copy I change James Cameron to Tony Stone and my name so we know we run it.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.550
We're pulling in the right file.

01:28.610 --> 01:36.660
So I go back into my file pads and I simply put it in t x t t x t

01:40.580 --> 01:50.330
files forward slash and I call this file copy of moviestar XTi of movie 30 XTi.

01:50.510 --> 01:51.290
There we go.

01:52.890 --> 01:56.910
So the forward slash is relevant for Linux and OS X users in Windows.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.290
It would be a backslash like that.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.980
Let's run that and see if it works.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.270
There we go.

02:04.340 --> 02:10.790
It's jumped from a working directory which is files into our tax files directory and it's found copy

02:10.790 --> 02:18.200
of moviestar XTi we can also use what are called absolute file paths these five parts to help Huyton

02:18.230 --> 02:23.710
exactly where the file is on our computer regardless of where the program that's being executed is stored.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.890
Absolute file parts are usually longer and well-defined parts.

02:26.970 --> 02:30.720
So it's helpful to store them in a variable and then pass the variable to open.

02:30.720 --> 02:35.130
I'm going to post this video now and go off and get the absolute file part from my copy of movies t

02:35.250 --> 02:35.850
XTi.

02:36.010 --> 02:36.780
OK welcome back.

02:36.780 --> 02:40.900
So I've gone off and I've gotten the file path to my copies of movies don t s t.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.180
So what we want to do here now is we want to save that file part in a variable.

02:45.210 --> 02:46.520
So we're going to call that variable.

02:46.630 --> 02:47.550
Something very obvious.

02:47.550 --> 02:52.440
File Path equals paste in there we go.

02:52.470 --> 03:03.310
Now what I want to do is I want to put in the name of my file so it's a copy of movies Dr. X take.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.810
Perfect.

03:04.830 --> 03:06.660
Now I want to take this out here.

03:08.480 --> 03:13.900
And inside it I want to say the name of my variable file path.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.520
There we go.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.220
Let's run that and see what we get.

03:17.450 --> 03:18.040
Perfect.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.580
Works like a charm.

03:19.610 --> 03:22.130
So now you can put it in the relative path to your files.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.840
Doing so with a variable.

03:24.260 --> 03:27.740
I hope all that made sense if you have any questions please let me know and I'll see you in the next

03:27.740 --> 03:28.190
lecture.
