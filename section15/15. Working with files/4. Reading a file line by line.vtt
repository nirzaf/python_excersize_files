Hi everybody and welcome back this lecture we're going to be looking at reading a file line by line

00:05.530 --> 00:10.600
so that you can see here I have a file now I have a file created called reading line by line up.

00:10.860 --> 00:16.610
And I have a movie line by line RTX which will be available in the resources and I just have libber

00:16.610 --> 00:20.230
more information into our movies line by line that he XTi.

00:20.240 --> 00:25.650
So I've taken out the first 12 movies from the I am the export or data set that I got.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.580
And again I'll make that dataset available in the resources.

00:29.030 --> 00:33.060
So when we're reading a file we'll sometimes want to examine each line of the file.

00:33.290 --> 00:37.250
We might be looking for a second piece of information in the file to perform a certain task.

00:38.290 --> 00:42.680
We can use a for loop on the file object we examine each line from a file.

00:42.700 --> 00:43.680
So how would we do that.

00:43.810 --> 00:53.720
Well like last night you would say create a variable called file name equals let's say movies line by

00:55.250 --> 00:58.230
line t s t.

00:58.370 --> 00:59.020
There we go.

00:59.890 --> 01:04.580
Next we have it open.

01:04.720 --> 01:12.830
We put in a very file name as File object color.

01:12.940 --> 01:13.780
There we go.

01:13.780 --> 01:22.320
Now we create a for loop so for line in file object print line.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.920
And I see what that gives us that run us.

01:26.980 --> 01:28.520
There we go.

01:28.900 --> 01:35.140
We have our information from our movies line by line that XTi all printed out here.

01:35.200 --> 01:40.230
Now as you can see there's an extra piece of space here and we'll address that now in a few minutes.

01:40.270 --> 01:42.380
So let's just run through this file really quickly.

01:42.510 --> 01:48.170
Line five we store the name of the file we're reading into the variable file name a common convention

01:48.170 --> 01:51.860
I'm working with files the variable font name doesn't represent the actual file.

01:51.850 --> 01:59.240
It just represents a string telling Python where to find a file offered us here at Line 7 after we call

01:59.240 --> 02:05.230
open an object representing the file and its contents is stored in the variable file object.

02:05.320 --> 02:09.570
Again we use the syntax to open and close the file properly.

02:10.780 --> 02:16.650
Next up line 8 we go through each line in the file by looping over to file object.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.470
And as I just said when our file prints out you'll notice some new blank lines.

02:20.470 --> 02:25.070
These appear because an invisible newline character is at the end of each line in the text file.

02:25.150 --> 02:31.000
The print statement adds its own new line each time we call it so we can remove this by using that strip

02:34.560 --> 02:35.310
and there we go.

02:37.010 --> 02:38.140
So I hope that made sense.

02:38.150 --> 02:41.280
How to access a file and read it line by line using a for loop.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.970
I'd be looking at this in more detail later on.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.900
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
