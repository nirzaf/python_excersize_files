Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.620 --> 00:04.660
Now this lecture we're going to look at making a list from afar.

00:04.860 --> 00:08.970
So as you can see I've created a new file here called making a list from a file and I've just given

00:08.970 --> 00:11.190
it the title making a list from a file.

00:11.640 --> 00:18.840
In previous lectures we've been using with open to start our programs and when we use with the file

00:18.840 --> 00:23.290
object returned by Open is only available inside the block that contains it.

00:23.430 --> 00:28.320
If you want to retain access to a file's contents outside the block we can store defined lines in a

00:28.320 --> 00:31.140
list inside the block and then work with that list.

00:31.140 --> 00:37.020
Let's look an example that stores the lines of movies line by line itx in a list inside the block and

00:37.020 --> 00:38.960
then print the lines outside the block.

00:39.030 --> 00:40.270
And how do we get started.

00:40.380 --> 00:45.060
Well we start with our file name variable equals movies.

00:47.530 --> 00:48.960
Line by line.

00:49.120 --> 00:54.040
I should probably shorten this down push no matter what we have for the moment that XTi.

00:54.100 --> 01:01.000
Next we have with open file names who are variable and there is file object.

01:01.090 --> 01:16.870
So nothing new so far called next lines equals a File object that read like brackets and then we remove

01:16.870 --> 01:19.910
an then so forward line in line.

01:21.320 --> 01:29.160
Let's call it print line dot strip brackets.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.030
Now let's run this and see what we guess.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.170
There we go.

01:33.240 --> 01:38.370
Now this looks like the same output as the last lecture and in appearance wise it is.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.860
But now this information is all stored in a list and we can start to modify and do things this list

01:43.860 --> 01:49.920
that we've seen in previous lectures such as work on the first five films in the list work on the last

01:49.920 --> 01:52.180
five of the list or start searching through the list.

01:52.350 --> 01:56.810
But we look at how to manipulate information and things like that a little later on.

01:57.360 --> 02:01.650
So let's just run through this program and have a look at some of the some of the bits that we may not

02:01.650 --> 02:02.580
have seen before.

02:03.790 --> 02:11.010
So at line 8 here the Red Line method takes each line from the file and stores it in a list.

02:11.020 --> 02:17.860
This list is then stored in lines which we can continue to work with after the block ends here at line

02:17.860 --> 02:22.180
10 are using a simple for loop to print each line from lines.

02:22.270 --> 02:26.680
So although the output looks the same it is very very different from the previous lecture.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.600
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
