Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:04.760 --> 00:09.830
Now in our last lecture we looked at reading the contents of a file into a list and it was this program

00:09.830 --> 00:10.560
here.

00:10.670 --> 00:12.230
So I run it again.

00:12.230 --> 00:17.420
I get the contents of my file in a list and as I said even though it looks like the output of previous

00:17.420 --> 00:20.630
lectures before it out it's very different because it's in a list.

00:20.630 --> 00:23.830
And once we have our information in a list we can start to work with it.

00:23.930 --> 00:25.040
So let's see what can we do.

00:25.040 --> 00:30.260
Well if you go back to the section on lists you'll get some ideas of what we can do such as popping

00:30.260 --> 00:33.710
items from the list sorting lists and so on and so on.

00:33.710 --> 00:35.420
So let's just start here with print

00:38.340 --> 00:39.410
backslash new line.

00:39.420 --> 00:43.230
Let's add in some hyphens just so we can separate out a different list.

00:43.230 --> 00:45.510
I don't know where it starts and ends.

00:45.660 --> 00:46.550
New line again.

00:46.570 --> 00:47.770
And there we go.

00:47.790 --> 00:53.260
So let's just say that we want to remove an item from our list.

00:53.260 --> 00:53.910
How do we do that.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.580
Well let's use the pop method.

00:56.020 --> 01:03.340
So pop movies or pop movie equals lines that pop.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.100
So we used this method way back when in our section so go back there.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.740
Now have a lot to do and get some ideas of how you can start to manipulate the information from a file.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.280
When you put it into a list.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.110
So with that there.

01:14.110 --> 01:15.820
Now let's look at your list again.

01:15.820 --> 01:18.730
So for line in lines

01:24.660 --> 01:28.590
line dot strip OK.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.800
Let's run that and see what we got.

01:30.810 --> 01:31.550
There we go.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.490
So let me just move this up a little bit.

01:33.570 --> 01:39.780
So there's a first list and that is 12 12 item long list there.

01:39.810 --> 01:45.330
Now as you can see at the end of our second list Max Foster who directed Quantum of Solace has been

01:45.330 --> 01:47.120
removed from our list.

01:47.120 --> 01:47.740
OK.

01:48.020 --> 01:51.070
So there's one example.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.000
What else can we do.

01:52.130 --> 01:56.310
Well let's just copy this and create a new line again.

01:56.630 --> 01:57.510
There we go.

01:57.770 --> 02:08.030
Let's say we want to sort our list alphabetically sorted list equals lines that sort.

02:08.030 --> 02:09.480
And again let's look at your list.

02:09.510 --> 02:12.270
So for line in lines.

02:12.500 --> 02:12.970
Print line

02:16.140 --> 02:19.180
dot strip removing any and all whitespace.

02:19.410 --> 02:20.580
That's Ramdass.

02:20.970 --> 02:21.480
And there we go.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.290
Now let me just expand this up again.

02:25.230 --> 02:29.260
You can see here now that our target list has been arranged alphabetically.

02:29.430 --> 02:30.030
OK.

02:30.030 --> 02:33.780
So I hope that gives you an example of what you can do once you have your files contents read into a

02:33.780 --> 02:34.440
list.

02:34.440 --> 02:38.710
So if you want more ideas on what you can do with your files go back to the section on list.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.150
Have a look there and get some ideas on how you can manipulate your list.

02:42.150 --> 02:43.890
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next Lechter.
