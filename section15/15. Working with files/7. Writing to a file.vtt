Hi everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be talking about how to write to a file

00:04.710 --> 00:07.490
and specifically how to write to an empty file.

00:07.770 --> 00:11.340
Now obviously one of the simplest ways to save data is to write to a file.

00:11.340 --> 00:15.910
This way whatever information you save to a file is available even after your program closes.

00:16.290 --> 00:20.780
So to write an empty file we need to first call open like we did previously.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.130
For the second argument telling Python that we want to write to the file.

00:24.360 --> 00:31.920
So let's take a look now at a simple example where we start off with a file name variable filename equals.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.310
Well I'm just going to give it a name now.

00:33.330 --> 00:37.620
So programming that T x t.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.500
So that's what our file is going to be called.

00:40.840 --> 00:46.520
We're open to put in a file name ferryboat come up w.

00:46.630 --> 00:58.700
So you can probably guess what W stands for as File object underscore object call it so file object.

00:59.070 --> 01:03.660
Rice let's give it something simple to write to a file.

01:03.680 --> 01:11.040
Hello my name is Tony or whatever your name is.

01:11.040 --> 01:16.530
Now let's run and say let's say even run us and as you can see down the bottom left nothing outputted

01:16.570 --> 01:18.090
but a file did run.

01:18.240 --> 01:23.130
And if you noticed on the left hand side of my file listing here a new file popped in called programming

01:23.130 --> 01:25.770
that XTi and I click on that.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.620
Here we have our insert message.

01:27.660 --> 01:30.230
Hello my name is Tony saved to a file.

01:31.940 --> 01:34.680
So in this example I called Open has two arguments.

01:34.850 --> 01:36.690
The first argument is still the name of the file.

01:36.710 --> 01:42.560
We want to open the second argument w tells pide that we want to open a file in write mode.

01:42.560 --> 01:49.250
If I leave out this Ogwyn Python opens the file in read only mode by default you can open a file in

01:49.250 --> 01:56.680
read mode or write mode W or append mode a or in a mode that allows you to read and write to a file

01:57.080 --> 02:03.470
or plus the open function automatically creates the file you're writing to it.

02:03.530 --> 02:04.630
If it doesn't exist.

02:04.670 --> 02:11.000
However if it does exist and you open the file in right w mode will erase the file before returning

02:11.000 --> 02:12.410
the file object.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.460
This line here.

02:13.460 --> 02:14.570
Line 8.

02:14.570 --> 02:18.490
We use the write method on the file object to write a string to the file.

02:18.500 --> 02:23.090
Now it's worth noting at this point the pipe and can only write strings with text file if you want to

02:23.090 --> 02:24.310
store numbers in a text file.

02:24.320 --> 02:29.000
You have to convert them to a string format using the string bracket function.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.060
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
