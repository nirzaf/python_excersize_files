Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.220 --> 00:05.690
Now in this lecture we're going to look at how to write multiple lines to a file.

00:05.790 --> 00:09.690
So the write function doesn't to add any new lines to the text we write.

00:09.720 --> 00:13.990
So if you write more than one line without including a newline character you will not get it cleaned

00:14.010 --> 00:15.190
the formatted file.

00:15.540 --> 00:20.160
So we're going to take a look at an example that is now and we're also going to look at is an example

00:20.160 --> 00:24.110
of the a function and that is how to append to a file.

00:24.110 --> 00:26.510
So we're going to look at those two examples now.

00:26.650 --> 00:31.680
So we're going start off simply with message to creating a variable called Message equals input.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.440
So we're going to look for some user input.

00:34.440 --> 00:39.990
I'm going to ask the user what is your favorite film

00:43.600 --> 00:43.990
OK.

00:43.990 --> 00:44.570
There we go.

00:44.570 --> 00:50.350
Now we're going to print message title.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.280
OK so we all know what that does.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.620
And just for good measure let's make sure it works.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.150
There you go what is your favorite film.

00:58.050 --> 01:00.720
OK so now we create our file name very file name.

01:00.820 --> 01:07.350
Equals favorite film ok.

01:07.470 --> 01:08.380
T x t.

01:10.120 --> 01:21.320
Next with open file name comma quote A to A for a pen a File object

01:25.950 --> 01:27.540
and we have the file object variable.

01:27.540 --> 01:28.770
File object.

01:28.810 --> 01:33.000
Right.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.390
I'm going to write our message so we get from the user

01:38.260 --> 01:41.480
I'm going to put it in a new line.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.900
OK there we go.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.420
So let's just take a quick look at this.

01:44.420 --> 01:46.400
So the beginning of the file line 5.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.660
We asked the user what is our favorite film.

01:48.680 --> 01:54.890
We print out the question we then create a line 8 new variable which stores the file favorite film that

01:55.010 --> 01:58.390
t XTi then that line 10.

01:58.580 --> 02:04.900
We call that variable again which obviously opens our file favorite film that he and then opens it with

02:04.900 --> 02:05.790
the method.

02:05.860 --> 02:11.420
Which means that we can append information to our file and line 11.

02:11.430 --> 02:15.570
We then write the message write the input that we get from the user onto a new line.

02:15.570 --> 02:19.080
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to open this up an idle and let's see how it works.

02:19.080 --> 02:22.070
I'll be back in just one moment when I've opened up my idle editor.

02:22.260 --> 02:26.700
OK everybody so I'm here my idol and I've got to open and why am I switching into my idol because you

02:26.700 --> 02:30.390
might remember sublime does not allow for user input but idle thoughts.

02:30.390 --> 02:32.750
So let's run this file.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.150
There we go.

02:33.150 --> 02:34.430
What is your favorite film.

02:34.430 --> 02:45.440
So my favorite film is give me a film Give me it's Christmas so let's say Santa Claus Santa Claus.

02:45.570 --> 02:46.150
There we go.

02:46.150 --> 02:46.970
The Santa Claus.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.870
OK it doesn't look like it does much.

02:48.870 --> 02:50.690
But let's jump back into our editor.

02:51.690 --> 02:58.300
And let's see now did we cast a favorite film that he XTi we did when we ran the program and end it

02:58.570 --> 02:59.620
to Santa Claus.

02:59.800 --> 03:06.370
Let's go back to Ireland not in a new film run this again.

03:06.400 --> 03:14.550
What is your favorite film to Santa Claus to.

03:14.850 --> 03:15.420
There we go.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.840
Let's go back to our file.

03:17.850 --> 03:18.400
There you are.

03:18.390 --> 03:24.780
To Santa Claus to all working away perfectly so we can see the append method and a new line method in

03:24.780 --> 03:26.180
action here.

03:26.190 --> 03:26.820
OK.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.190
So that brings this section on files to a close but this is only a basic introduction into writing and

03:32.190 --> 03:33.490
saving the files.

03:33.540 --> 03:36.380
We have a files part two coming up so I'll see you there.

03:36.570 --> 03:38.520
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
