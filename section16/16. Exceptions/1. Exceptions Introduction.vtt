Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.980 --> 00:05.860
Now we're moving into a new section and that section is called exceptions.

00:06.090 --> 00:08.760
So what happens while running our programs and error occurs.

00:08.760 --> 00:14.010
Well we've already seen several pilot errors during these lectures so intentional and most not intentional

00:14.810 --> 00:19.350
pite and use of special objects called exceptions to manage errors that arise during the running of

00:19.350 --> 00:20.120
a program.

00:20.460 --> 00:25.350
We can write code to handle exceptions and our programs will continue to run if we don't our programs

00:25.350 --> 00:30.810
will stop and show a traceback which includes a report of the exception that was raised exceptions are

00:30.810 --> 00:36.140
handled with try except blocks a try except block as applied and do something.

00:36.210 --> 00:40.140
But it also tells Python what to do if an exception is raised.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.730
Try except blocks when things go wrong.

00:42.810 --> 00:47.610
Users will see a helpful error message instead of the ugly traceback message that we've seen so far.

00:47.940 --> 00:52.710
So let's jump right in and have a look at how we start creating these helpful error messages.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.840
I see you in the next lecture.
