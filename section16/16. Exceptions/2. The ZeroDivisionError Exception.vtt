Hi everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to look at handling the 0 division error.

00:06.060 --> 00:10.580
So as we all know we can't divide a number by zero but let's give it a try anyway.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.830
So what we have in this lecture let's print.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.300
Here we go here.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.450
Print 5 divided by zero OK.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.860
Let's run this and see what we get.

00:21.170 --> 00:22.040
We get an error.

00:22.390 --> 00:22.820
OK.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.380
At least that's what we wanted.

00:24.380 --> 00:27.350
The error reported is a zero division error.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.930
And you can see that here Zero Division.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.160
Division by zero.

00:31.250 --> 00:36.290
And this is an exception object pite and creates this kind of object in response to a situation where

00:36.290 --> 00:38.490
it can't do what we ask it to do.

00:38.540 --> 00:41.190
We can use this information to modify our program.

00:41.450 --> 00:44.840
We are told heighten what to do when this kind of exception occurs.

00:44.840 --> 00:48.900
Which means that if it were to happen again we would be prepared in the next lecture.

00:49.010 --> 00:52.010
We're look at handling this one a try except luck.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.760
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
