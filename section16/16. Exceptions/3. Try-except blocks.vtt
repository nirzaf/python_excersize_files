Hi everybody and welcome back and this lecture we're going to look at using a try except block to handle

00:04.830 --> 00:06.660
the error that we saw in the last lecture.

00:06.810 --> 00:07.960
The 0 division error.

00:08.090 --> 00:10.740
So as we saw in The Last Lecture We cannot divide by zero.

00:10.740 --> 00:18.240
So when we tried to print five divided by zero we got an error and there it is there are zero division

00:18.240 --> 00:18.590
error.

00:18.630 --> 00:19.620
Let's remove that.

00:19.890 --> 00:22.570
So how can we handle that using a try except block.

00:22.860 --> 00:26.160
Well we go try colon print.

00:26.580 --> 00:29.050
So here's where we know the error is going to come up.

00:29.220 --> 00:33.150
So whenever we think an error might occur we can write a try except block the handle exceptions that

00:33.150 --> 00:34.450
we think might arise.

00:34.470 --> 00:41.340
So we think this might arise in error so we're going to put in the try except block except what we have

00:41.340 --> 00:48.520
here is our 0 0 division error.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.380
There we go colon.

00:51.540 --> 00:53.740
And what we want to happen if this error occurs.

00:53.790 --> 01:03.260
What we wanted to say is you cannot divide by zero.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.560
Here we go.

01:04.900 --> 01:05.810
Print.

01:05.830 --> 01:13.270
You don't have to put this in but I just put this in for completion sake print please enter an order

01:13.270 --> 01:13.950
number.

01:14.350 --> 01:14.790
OK.

01:14.830 --> 01:15.320
There we go.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.060
Let's roll this and see what happens.

01:17.580 --> 01:17.850
OK.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.340
You kind of divide by zero please and reduce the number.

01:20.350 --> 01:24.750
So if this were part of a larger program our use would know to try and note a number other than zero

01:26.370 --> 01:31.530
one more code follows a try except block the program or continue to run as we just seen here.

01:31.530 --> 01:32.880
Please enter another number.

01:33.170 --> 01:38.150
So that's how we can use a try except block to anticipate and help control errors.

01:38.340 --> 01:40.290
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
