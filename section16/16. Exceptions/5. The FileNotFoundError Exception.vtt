Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.180 --> 00:05.790
Now in this short lecture we're going to look at the file not found error.

00:05.880 --> 00:12.090
So as you can see here I've renamed this file file not found and I've entered in some simple text file

00:12.090 --> 00:12.670
name.

00:12.690 --> 00:18.090
Tony got the XTi to make sure whatever file name here you enter you don't have within your working folder.

00:18.410 --> 00:24.510
And any event today in what we've seen previously with open variable named file name on file object

00:24.750 --> 00:27.070
contents equals file object up read.

00:27.210 --> 00:29.740
So read the contents that are in our file.

00:29.930 --> 00:30.390
OK.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.720
What happens if I try and run this when I get an error.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.640
Thankfully it's an error we wanted.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.560
And as you can see here we have a file not found error.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.180
No such file or directory.

00:41.180 --> 00:42.530
Tony directx T.

00:42.770 --> 00:46.310
So how do we handle this a little bit better because obviously we don't want the program stopping like

00:46.310 --> 00:46.880
this.

00:46.880 --> 00:51.390
If we cannot find a file which is a very common task and probably a very common error.

00:51.470 --> 00:55.190
So let's say try calling.

00:55.520 --> 01:01.380
Now let's indent error width and we have to invent our contents.

01:01.430 --> 01:09.860
So after a read we enter and go back tab back a couple and that are in the line except file not found

01:09.860 --> 01:10.530
error.

01:10.710 --> 01:20.910
Colden message equals sorry the file comma.

01:20.910 --> 01:25.830
Sorry the file and what we can do here is we can actually put in the file names because we have that

01:25.830 --> 01:27.210
as a variable variable.

01:27.210 --> 01:34.190
So plus filename plus quotes again cannot be found.

01:34.470 --> 01:39.500
OK so nice and clean and a nice message elsewhere user then to finish this off.

01:39.500 --> 01:45.170
We have print message perfect.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.560
So let's run this now and see what we get.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.740
Absolutely beautiful.

01:49.740 --> 01:53.150
Sorry to file Tony that he XTi cannot be found.

01:53.160 --> 01:57.450
So a very simple example of how to make our programs a little bit more user friendly and provide some

01:57.450 --> 01:59.930
feedback for users as to what the error is.

01:59.930 --> 02:00.730
Exactly.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.790
So thanks for listening and I see you in the next lecture.
