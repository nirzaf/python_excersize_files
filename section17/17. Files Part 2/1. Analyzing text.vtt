Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:03.040 --> 00:06.010
Now we're moving into a new section which is phials part two.

00:06.190 --> 00:09.940
And in the section we're going to look at some more advanced topics of working with files.

00:10.060 --> 00:15.640
So this lecture is called analyzing text and we can analyze text files containing large amounts of information

00:15.640 --> 00:18.350
such as you've guessed it books.

00:18.850 --> 00:21.370
And did you know that I couldn't bear that org.

00:21.430 --> 00:27.460
You can download the text files of classic books and this program will use the string method split which

00:27.460 --> 00:34.640
can build a list of words from a string to split method separate a string into parts wherever it finds

00:34.640 --> 00:38.210
a space and stores all the parts of a string in a list.

00:38.230 --> 00:40.320
Let's have a look at how we can do that.

00:40.840 --> 00:41.840
Let's start off with.

00:41.910 --> 00:44.620
Filename equals in quotes.

00:44.660 --> 00:53.240
Pete cliff and if anybody has not read wondering Heights Well I highly recommend that.

00:53.530 --> 00:58.870
And now is the time to get reading and he cliff is one of the main characters from watering heights.

00:59.880 --> 01:03.810
So try it open.

01:03.830 --> 01:04.540
What are we opening.

01:04.540 --> 01:07.380
Well we're opening our file name which is our file.

01:07.410 --> 01:16.260
Cliff has a file object so as to where you file object

01:19.060 --> 01:21.580
contents what you want to do with the contents.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.890
Because what we want to assign the contents file object and then we want to read that contents

01:30.830 --> 01:41.290
now like in a previous lectures except file not found.

01:41.330 --> 01:43.030
So if we got a file not found error

01:47.240 --> 01:52.390
message equals sorry.

01:54.360 --> 02:02.560
The file plus file name we're building in some nice area features here.

02:04.530 --> 02:05.460
Cannot be found

02:09.080 --> 02:10.910
cannot be found.

02:13.030 --> 02:17.020
If we go next print message

02:20.860 --> 02:22.810
else.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.040
Words equals content.

02:27.050 --> 02:28.950
Never going to count the words in our file.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.210
Words that split

02:35.830 --> 02:44.510
the number of words equals Eliane which is lengths that counts the number of words.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.400
Then print

02:49.410 --> 02:50.030
the file

02:53.230 --> 02:54.580
plus filename

02:57.590 --> 02:59.870
plus approximately

03:06.100 --> 03:10.370
proximately plus.

03:10.560 --> 03:22.810
Now we need to convert our number of words to a string so string number words plus words.

03:23.210 --> 03:27.650
OK now let's run this and make sure it works for us.

03:29.450 --> 03:34.540
Define heatless Dotty XTi has approximately one hundred eighteen thousand eight hundred ninety nine

03:34.540 --> 03:35.060
words in it.

03:35.080 --> 03:38.980
OK so a lot of words Dario's That's how many words are in our file.

03:39.070 --> 03:41.030
He claimed that he XTi.

03:41.290 --> 03:42.950
So how were we able to do that.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.910
But let's just have a quick run to a file.

03:45.130 --> 03:50.790
So we started off at a variable filename and we signed up the text he Cliff Dotti x T.

03:50.950 --> 03:52.770
Then we have our try block.

03:52.870 --> 03:56.560
So with open file names are open or variable fun name which is our file.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.310
He clicked that the X day as File object.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.630
Then we create a variable content's equals a file object out read.

04:02.650 --> 04:06.500
So read the entire file object in the contents.

04:06.660 --> 04:14.610
If we cannot find a file we output an error message sorry the file cannot be found otherwise to words.

04:14.610 --> 04:20.670
So then we assign contents that split as we mentioned earlier on the split method separate the string

04:20.670 --> 04:25.560
into parts where ever it finds the space and stores all the parts of a string in a list.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.890
So we have contents that split.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.460
To words the variable words.

04:30.540 --> 04:31.640
Then we have another variable.

04:31.650 --> 04:38.470
The number of words equals the length of words and then we simply print out the file name and a string

04:38.560 --> 04:39.590
number of words.

04:40.700 --> 04:45.320
So a lot coming together put an excellent piece of code an excellent little program.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.120
Thanks for listening.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.600
Do you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
