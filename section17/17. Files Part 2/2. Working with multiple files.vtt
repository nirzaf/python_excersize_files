Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.300 --> 00:04.840
Now in this lecture going to be looking at analyzing some more books.

00:04.850 --> 00:09.680
But before we do that let's practice something from an earlier section of the book of a program to a

00:09.680 --> 00:15.150
function called word count doesn't make it easier to deal with multiple books.

00:15.170 --> 00:19.860
So what we have to do to move this all into a function well we first need to create a function.

00:19.910 --> 00:26.450
Let's take this line out and replace it with the F word count.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.500
And the problem we're going to parse it is filename.

00:30.510 --> 00:32.380
There we go.

00:33.090 --> 00:41.440
And as always with a function as we enter the description count the number of words in a file.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.290
Here we go close that up.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.750
So next we just remove the space here.

00:46.970 --> 00:52.350
So try but what we need to do is meet a little bit of indentation so little a little bit like moving.

00:52.490 --> 00:57.090
So that last indent this line content's gets indented.

00:57.150 --> 01:03.850
Now except luck here gets indented one says our message and our print line.

01:03.910 --> 01:13.430
Here we go and else gets indented words or number of words and our print OK there we go so we started

01:13.430 --> 01:18.910
our function you see and and what we want to do now is we want to create a list of files that we want

01:18.920 --> 01:19.540
one life.

01:19.540 --> 01:23.250
So file names equals.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.590
And let's just start with one.

01:24.610 --> 01:32.840
Let's go cliff because we know we have that in the right location that T S T OK.

01:32.860 --> 01:42.530
So for file name in file name so we know what all of this does in filenames.

01:42.550 --> 01:46.380
Now let's call it a function word count.

01:47.380 --> 01:50.720
And that's part of the file filename.

01:50.730 --> 01:51.470
There we go.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.390
OK so let's see what this does.

01:54.090 --> 01:54.860
OK.

01:54.870 --> 01:56.690
The output is the exact same.

01:56.790 --> 02:01.390
There we are but let's here in our list of files given a new file.

02:01.680 --> 02:11.950
And let's say if I had another classic book from Gottenburg dot org which could be Moby-Dick the T S

02:11.970 --> 02:12.460
T.

02:12.630 --> 02:14.690
Let's run it again.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.010
Sorry to find Moby-Dick cannot be found.

02:17.010 --> 02:20.700
And that's right because in my file structure here I don't have Moby-Dick.

02:20.700 --> 02:25.890
So what we've done here now is we've moved the program from last lecture into a function called word

02:25.890 --> 02:27.150
count.

02:27.150 --> 02:33.170
We then down the bottom create a simple loop to count the words in antitax we want to analyze.

02:33.210 --> 02:39.750
So Cliff Moby Dick and we've also called the error far not found error which helps the program to continue

02:39.750 --> 02:41.160
on as if nothing happened.

02:41.950 --> 02:43.840
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
