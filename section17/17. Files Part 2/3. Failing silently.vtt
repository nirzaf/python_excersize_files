Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.160 --> 00:06.690
Now there will be times when you don't want to report every exception to the user so your program can

00:06.690 --> 00:11.430
have errors in the background and the user doesn't have to know about it but you will need some sort

00:11.430 --> 00:13.010
of error reporting system.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.170
And we'll talk about that later.

00:14.250 --> 00:19.620
Instead you'll want the program to fail silently and continue as if nothing happened to make the program

00:19.620 --> 00:20.800
fail silently.

00:20.820 --> 00:25.130
You write you write a try block and then tell Python to do nothing except block.

00:25.170 --> 00:27.420
You can do this by using the past Egmond.

00:27.450 --> 00:28.180
So how we do that.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.070
Well that's comment out the code in error.

00:31.080 --> 00:36.010
Except BLOCK So here we go and take that out as well.

00:36.280 --> 00:44.580
And all we put in here now is pass and what's going to happen now is pipe is going to continue on as

00:44.580 --> 00:48.600
if nothing had happened nothing has gone wrong in a program and a user will never know.

00:48.660 --> 00:49.910
So let's run our program.

00:50.310 --> 00:50.600
OK.

00:50.660 --> 00:51.480
There we go the file.

00:51.630 --> 00:54.870
Cliff has approximately 180 and has more ads in it.

00:54.870 --> 00:57.720
And as you can see here it's still looking for the Moby Dick program.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.730
But unlike in our last lecture you.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.760
An error is not reported to the user.

01:02.280 --> 01:07.320
So now when a file not found error is raised to code except block runs but nothing happens.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.550
And this can be very this can be very helpful in other programs where you don't want to use to know

01:11.550 --> 01:15.810
that something has gone wrong but you might want to have a file an error log in the background running

01:16.020 --> 01:19.200
which makes note and makes diagnostics a little bit easier.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.240
So thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
