00:00.930 --> 00:04.130
So how do we use Jason load to read or list back into memory.

00:04.140 --> 00:08.670
Well as you can see here I've created a new file called Jason download and I just change the title to

00:08.670 --> 00:10.590
working with Jason download.

00:10.620 --> 00:11.810
So what we do.

00:11.820 --> 00:16.250
Well again the first thing we need to do is import Jason.

00:16.610 --> 00:17.090
OK.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.350
Now the file name again so we're creating a variable equals.

00:21.390 --> 00:23.760
I'm always a fun name from The Last Lecture phone number

00:26.260 --> 00:27.770
Jason.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.730
OK.

00:30.490 --> 00:35.050
And with open pass or variable file name or just reading this.

00:35.050 --> 00:39.480
There's no need to put in an attribute file name as File object

00:44.540 --> 00:47.370
colon phone numbers.

00:49.460 --> 00:54.370
Equals Jason dot load.

00:54.460 --> 00:57.710
I to be loading what we're loading the file object variable.

00:57.910 --> 01:01.100
Then print phone numbers or printer or file.

01:01.180 --> 01:06.760
Print out the contents of a file that we've just created and now load it back into memory that's run

01:06.760 --> 01:07.930
this.

01:07.960 --> 01:08.810
There we go.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.950
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.

01:11.950 --> 01:18.100
So we've just seen how to create a file that saves user input and then have to load that file back into

01:18.100 --> 01:20.240
memory and output that back to the user.

01:20.410 --> 01:26.600
So here just a quick recap we make sure to read from the same file for name phone number.

01:26.810 --> 01:34.390
Then we open the file in read only mode and because we pass no attribute here such as W A or or it automatically

01:34.390 --> 01:40.100
opens in read only mode we don't use the adjacent download function here to load the information stored

01:40.100 --> 01:44.090
in our file and we store it in the variable phone numbers.

01:44.480 --> 01:49.850
And then here we print phone numbers so not too complicated but very very helpful.

01:49.890 --> 01:51.810
And an excellent program to know.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.960
So thanks for listening and I see you in the next lecture.
