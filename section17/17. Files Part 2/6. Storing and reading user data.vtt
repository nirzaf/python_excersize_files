00:00.750 --> 00:02.220
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.840
Now let's look an example of storing user data so that when you use or close the program their info

00:06.840 --> 00:07.800
is not lost.

00:07.980 --> 00:10.440
Well then write a program to read it back.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.340
So how do we kick off.

00:11.340 --> 00:16.050
Well I've created a new file called storing user storing and reading user data and as you can see here

00:16.080 --> 00:18.030
I just changed my description in the comments.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.320
So for us like last lectures we import Jason.

00:22.590 --> 00:29.900
Next we create a very user name equals input.

00:30.120 --> 00:34.010
What is your user name.

00:35.540 --> 00:42.970
Next file names are creating a filename variable equals quote username.

00:43.250 --> 00:46.010
Jason.

00:46.050 --> 00:56.200
Now with open file name w surrounded by single quotes as File object

01:00.230 --> 01:06.880
colon J sunder dump or adjacent that dump method like we saw in previous lectures.

01:06.970 --> 01:07.580
Username

01:10.120 --> 01:11.150
file object

01:13.930 --> 01:17.350
print.

01:17.410 --> 01:22.230
Thank you.

01:22.490 --> 01:23.300
Remember you

01:28.740 --> 01:32.100
when you come back.

01:32.350 --> 01:33.320
OK there we go.

01:34.650 --> 01:39.180
Now let's say that not going to write and I'm going to jump on over to Idylls because as we know we're

01:39.180 --> 01:41.230
now a blank cannot take user input.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.850
So copy this and I'll see you in a second.

01:42.850 --> 01:43.420
In idle.

01:43.530 --> 01:44.360
OK welcome back.

01:44.380 --> 01:50.390
We are an idle and let's run this program what is your user name.

01:50.390 --> 01:52.780
Tony S Thank you.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.210
I'll remember you when you come back.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.870
OK so how do you get that information back out to the user.

01:57.910 --> 01:58.750
Well let's take a look.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.930
Let's jump on over back into our program.

02:01.060 --> 02:02.250
So here we are back and.

02:02.290 --> 02:06.090
And what we want to do is read our username back out to our user.

02:06.340 --> 02:19.420
So import J some file name equals quotes user name that Jason will have to the file name from a program

02:19.420 --> 02:21.610
previously with open

02:24.660 --> 02:30.450
file name as File object.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.500
There we go.

02:31.660 --> 02:40.680
Kholo username equals Jason Tarsh load.

02:40.900 --> 02:44.370
What are we loading we're loading our file object print

02:48.660 --> 02:49.470
Welcome back

02:52.590 --> 03:00.650
plus username plus exclamation in quotes of course.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.660
Now let's run a program and see what happens.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.340
There we go.

03:04.340 --> 03:05.030
Welcome back.

03:05.060 --> 03:05.730
Tony Yes.

03:05.810 --> 03:06.400
Excellent.

03:06.500 --> 03:10.940
So we've taken in what a user wants to be the user name and we put it back to the screen when they log

03:10.940 --> 03:11.420
back in.

03:11.420 --> 03:15.740
So this can work in any program where you're taking any user name and work on them back.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.660
Once they log back in.

03:17.660 --> 03:22.580
So in this one this program we use Jason that low to read information stored and username but Jason

03:22.820 --> 03:28.070
into the Facebook username and I put that back to the screen let's look at combining these two programs

03:28.070 --> 03:32.630
together sort of combine the two programs let's just get rid of what we have here.

03:32.700 --> 03:37.010
Let's start off with our import Jason.

03:37.390 --> 03:40.010
Filename equals

03:42.600 --> 03:46.740
user name Jason.

03:47.220 --> 03:49.960
Letter space there should be no space there Jason.

03:50.280 --> 03:54.430
Next we're going to implement something that we've seen previously try.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.740
So you can guess what that is wide open.

03:58.320 --> 03:58.880
So what are we doing.

03:58.880 --> 04:03.120
We're opening our file name file object

04:07.280 --> 04:13.310
username equals Jason load

04:17.530 --> 04:18.820
file object.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.170
OK.

04:20.650 --> 04:23.010
Now what happens if we don't find that file.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.450
Well we say except

04:28.950 --> 04:32.080
the file not found error

04:35.780 --> 04:38.200
username equals

04:42.630 --> 04:46.760
input.

04:46.960 --> 04:52.350
What is your username then.

04:52.380 --> 04:57.890
With open file name

05:00.990 --> 05:05.700
w because we want to write it as file as File object.

05:05.710 --> 05:06.790
Jason dump

05:11.320 --> 05:19.760
user name file object to put the file object into a file username and then print

05:23.980 --> 05:26.100
Thank you.

05:26.100 --> 05:33.450
I will remember you when you come back.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.370
There we go.

05:37.880 --> 05:46.980
Outs print.

05:47.020 --> 05:49.300
Welcome back.

05:49.300 --> 05:54.180
Plus user name plus quotes.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.120
Exclamation mark.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.070
There we go.

05:56.180 --> 05:59.200
That saved us now and hoping to Idol and see how it runs.

05:59.230 --> 06:04.120
We are back in Idol and let's run this program what is your username.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.990
Tony S.

06:06.250 --> 06:06.730
Thank you.

06:06.730 --> 06:08.280
I remember you when you come back.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.220
OK so does it actually remember us when we come back.

06:11.260 --> 06:12.590
Well let's take a look.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.610
Let's close this let's run this program again.

06:15.610 --> 06:16.300
There we go.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.750
Welcome back Tony.

06:17.890 --> 06:18.740
Perfect.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.040
Now in this program there is no new code.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.160
Just two previous examples combined.

06:23.290 --> 06:25.140
We began by importing Jaison.

06:25.180 --> 06:30.250
We then tried to open the file username that Jason that this file exists we use named back into memory

06:30.490 --> 06:34.090
and we then print the message welcoming welcoming back the user.

06:34.090 --> 06:36.040
It is the first time the user runs a program.

06:36.070 --> 06:41.180
Then the file user name but JCL will not exist and a file not found error might occur.

06:41.420 --> 06:46.060
Client will then move on to the access block where we prompt the user to enter the user name.

06:46.060 --> 06:50.280
We then use JSM that dump method to store to use name and print a greeting.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.010
So that's a combination of the previous two examples.

06:53.200 --> 06:58.060
And not only is that a combination of the last two files but is also something called refactoring which

06:58.060 --> 07:00.090
is work to improve our programs.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.200
And we'll talk about that briefly in the next section.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.330
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
