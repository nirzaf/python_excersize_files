Hi everybody.

00:01.250 --> 00:02.130
Welcome back.

00:02.370 --> 00:05.700
In this lecture we're going to be discussing variables.

00:05.920 --> 00:08.240
So what exactly is a variable.

00:08.240 --> 00:12.330
A variable is a name that represents or refers to a value.

00:12.590 --> 00:19.180
So a simple example is name equals or whatever your name is.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.480
In this case Tony for myself.

00:21.570 --> 00:29.660
So now we just create a variable called name and we've and we've assigned that variable value Tony.

00:29.760 --> 00:38.450
And let's change the example by typing the following first name equals the last name.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.730
Equals.

00:45.220 --> 00:47.030
And you can do the same for your name.

00:47.660 --> 00:52.420
So you can change the value of a variable at any time a pilot will always keep track slightly.

00:52.460 --> 00:57.680
So here's some pointers when you're naming your variables variable names consist of letters numbers

00:57.830 --> 00:59.270
and underscores.

00:59.270 --> 01:02.810
They can start with a letter or an underscore but not a number.

01:02.810 --> 01:12.020
So for example the variable name Name one is valid but the name one name is not valid.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.040
You cannot start a variable names with a number.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.730
Variable names cannot contain spaces.

01:18.950 --> 01:23.390
So use underscores to separate words of ideas on these two variable names above.

01:23.510 --> 01:26.340
And always remember to keep your variable names short on script.

01:26.350 --> 01:29.440
Now that we know what a variable is and has assign a value to it.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.490
How do we see what we've done.

01:31.580 --> 01:36.070
So how do we get our first name and last name variables out onto our screen.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.290
Well to do that we add the following lines.

01:39.350 --> 01:45.590
Print which outputs to your screen enter in the variable name first name.

01:45.590 --> 01:51.440
Print last name and your variable name.

01:51.610 --> 01:57.550
Once you have data on if you're using sublime like I am in a Mac you can press control and be that ruins

01:57.690 --> 02:02.500
your program and as you can see down on the bottom left we have totally stoned on the amount of time

02:02.500 --> 02:04.880
it took to run that program.

02:05.010 --> 02:06.870
That's a simple introduction to variables.

02:06.870 --> 02:09.930
Now it's time to try it yourself and your code editor of choice.

02:09.930 --> 02:10.900
Create a program.

02:10.950 --> 02:16.560
We just signed your first and last name to a variable then add the print statement with the values of

02:16.560 --> 02:18.470
your versions.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.010
Hopefully you can get that working.

02:20.060 --> 02:23.580
Any questions please do not hesitate to ask and I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:23.930 --> 02:24.260
Thank you.
