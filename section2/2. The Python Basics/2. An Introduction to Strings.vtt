00:00.630 --> 00:02.660
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.730 --> 00:06.080
Now in the previous lecture we assigned values to a variable.

00:06.210 --> 00:10.600
So just to refresh your memory this is the variable name.

00:10.860 --> 00:14.190
And this is the value put in double quotes that we assign to it.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.980
So we know what a variable is but what about the text under your side.

00:18.980 --> 00:22.460
What about this text here we didn't double quote Tony storms.

00:22.820 --> 00:24.840
Well this text is called a string.

00:25.090 --> 00:30.430
And that string has nothing got to do with the string of your guitar string of your bow or any other

00:30.450 --> 00:31.420
type of string.

00:31.460 --> 00:33.230
Put her down a string.

00:33.340 --> 00:34.140
Pite.

00:34.250 --> 00:40.040
I'm going to use the term string and python we are referring to a string of characters.

00:40.110 --> 00:45.400
So the main use of strings in Python is to represent bits of text like my name here.

00:45.510 --> 00:50.150
You can use single or double quotes of it as we have done here around your strings.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.590
So equally we could have done this

00:55.790 --> 00:59.370
and this would still be valid and Titan would still run it within your program.

00:59.900 --> 01:04.660
This flexibility also allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your strings.

01:04.700 --> 01:09.320
So let's say that we have a quote from a movie or something like that that we would like to put into

01:09.320 --> 01:16.160
a string so we would open with double quotes and then our quote within that line would be single quotes.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.360
So let's take a look at how that would look.

01:18.500 --> 01:27.360
So let's start with our variable which is moving in or movie like we are going to sign a sign at the

01:27.360 --> 01:31.470
value which starts with a double quote what then.

01:33.690 --> 01:37.750
Is this sort of an opening a question mark.

01:37.780 --> 01:42.330
And now we're going to put in the quote from a movie I'm going to start out with a single quote.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.860
So here we go.

01:43.890 --> 01:45.950
Show me the money.

01:46.290 --> 01:47.040
So there we go.

01:47.070 --> 01:50.090
And we close it again with a single quote.

01:50.250 --> 01:57.050
And as you can see here we still have our double quote closing our overall string of text.

01:57.060 --> 02:01.690
So like I said at the beginning this entire line is a string of text.

02:01.740 --> 02:04.820
It opens with a double quote I want in a line.

02:04.860 --> 02:08.070
We want to emphasize or emphasize or quote something.

02:08.250 --> 02:14.010
So we have that opening with a single quote and closing with a single quote and an overall string of

02:14.010 --> 02:16.410
text closes with a double quote.

02:16.620 --> 02:17.750
So that works both ways.

02:17.850 --> 02:21.260
We could have just as easily done this by take this out

02:24.170 --> 02:25.000
and I take this out.

02:25.020 --> 02:32.550
I can start on end this example with a single quote but what I need to do now is I need to just change

02:32.550 --> 02:36.540
these around three double quotes

02:39.430 --> 02:40.220
and just do that.

02:40.220 --> 02:48.520
Now here we go double double and a single to wrap it up.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.080
So Biden doesn't mind which one you use.

02:51.140 --> 02:56.990
It allows for flexibility and discipline and this flexibility as we've just seen here allows you to

02:56.990 --> 02:57.220
put.

02:57.230 --> 03:03.560
And this is what in your quotes when you string of characters Let's take a look at another example.

03:03.770 --> 03:09.620
If for some reason you don't like double quotes you can still use a single quote method but any single

03:09.620 --> 03:14.160
quotes would in your string well need to be escaped with the backslash character.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.640
And that goes like this.

03:16.670 --> 03:23.020
So we have our variable start equals and we opened with a single quote and now we have the word.

03:23.030 --> 03:26.640
Let's But we can't write that.

03:26.670 --> 03:27.460
That's what we need to do.

03:27.460 --> 03:30.500
Here is we need to escape this.

03:30.560 --> 03:37.200
This single quote with a backslash like that's let's get started.

03:38.330 --> 03:39.640
With Python.

03:40.650 --> 03:43.120
And we end this with a single quote.

03:43.440 --> 03:49.710
So as you can see here you can you can use single quotes to open and close your strings but if you're

03:49.710 --> 03:56.130
going to use a single quote well inside you need to escape it with a backslash character.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.850
So this has been a nice simple introduction into strings.

03:59.020 --> 04:02.110
And the next lecture we're going to look at are ways to use strings.

04:02.180 --> 04:03.000
What insight.

04:03.190 --> 04:04.920
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
