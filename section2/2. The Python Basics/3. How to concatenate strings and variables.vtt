Hi everybody and welcome back in the last lecture we got a nice simple introduction to strings.

00:05.230 --> 00:09.750
I'm going to continue continue to build on that introduction throughout the next few lectures.

00:09.750 --> 00:13.840
So in this lecture we're going to be talking about concatenating strings.

00:13.920 --> 00:18.420
Now if you're anything like me you have to google what concatenate means.

00:18.600 --> 00:23.110
And if you did you're not alone because when I first start learning programming languages so did I.

00:23.310 --> 00:30.700
So let's just take a quick look at what concatenation means concatenate means to link things in a chain

00:30.910 --> 00:32.000
or a series.

00:32.020 --> 00:34.520
Quite simply it means to combine things.

00:34.690 --> 00:37.120
And that's what we're going to be doing in this example.

00:37.120 --> 00:44.380
We are going to be combining strings here you say why can't I just type in a full sentence for a sentence

00:44.440 --> 00:45.700
or a string of characters.

00:45.790 --> 00:46.870
Well that's a good question.

00:46.870 --> 00:50.830
And let's take a look starting with our previous example.

00:50.830 --> 00:57.640
So we enter in our variable and we enter in the name so you can put in your own name here.

00:57.970 --> 00:58.710
OK.

00:58.900 --> 01:02.140
So we have a string and a string is my name.

01:02.140 --> 01:08.910
Tony Stuart but what happens if I want to output my program my first name or my last name.

01:08.950 --> 01:12.190
We might be working with a piece of software where it says hi.

01:12.370 --> 01:13.300
Your first name.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.260
So hi Tony.

01:14.260 --> 01:15.160
Welcome back.

01:15.230 --> 01:18.420
Or you might be writing an email template and it might be and might be.

01:18.430 --> 01:19.520
Dear Mr.

01:19.570 --> 01:20.590
And then your last name.

01:20.770 --> 01:26.920
We can't really do that here because this is all one string and pikemen doesn't know which is the first

01:26.920 --> 01:29.960
name on which is the last name to in.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.240
This all just one string.

01:32.600 --> 01:33.690
So how do we do that.

01:33.700 --> 01:38.530
How do we give it individual first name and last name and then how do we combine them to make a full

01:38.530 --> 01:38.950
name.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.190
Well let's take a look.

01:41.410 --> 01:44.700
Let me get rid of that and we'll start off with first name.

01:45.570 --> 01:59.490
So that's our first variable equals Tony and our last name equals Staunton OK so there we go.

01:59.490 --> 02:03.100
And later on the lecture where we talk about how to receive input from our users.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.870
But for now we can just imagine that we have a piece of software.

02:05.980 --> 02:10.730
We have an interface on the web that is asked for a user's first name and last name.

02:10.780 --> 02:15.730
So suppose you're building a piece of software that needs to store the first and last names in separate

02:15.730 --> 02:18.010
variables like we have just here.

02:18.220 --> 02:22.760
That piece of software my to combine them does display your own name.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.250
So think of your signature in an email program when you log in.

02:26.250 --> 02:30.540
It might say Hi Tony it might welcome you back to the software.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.820
So how does that happen.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.020
How do we do that.

02:33.550 --> 02:34.600
Let's take a look.

02:34.600 --> 02:41.110
So when I send an e-mail in my order populate my first name and in the opening signature so print So

02:41.220 --> 02:48.780
imagine this is in your email software program and we open up our double quotes and we say hi we leave

02:48.780 --> 02:51.150
a space and we quote close out of a quote.

02:51.150 --> 02:56.360
We then enter in the plus symbol and we enter in the variable first name.

02:56.790 --> 02:57.540
So there we go.

02:57.630 --> 03:01.790
What's going to happen there is that we are going to get the message high on a first name.

03:01.920 --> 03:11.780
In this example Tony what about if we were doing a more formal kind of email print that we open up a

03:11.780 --> 03:17.130
double called again Dear believe that we live in space there clothes or double quotes.

03:17.420 --> 03:23.520
Use the plus symbol again and we have a last name and I've actually just left out one small piece here.

03:23.550 --> 03:25.230
Dear Mr..

03:25.280 --> 03:28.350
And then a space and our last name.

03:28.580 --> 03:29.460
And that's how.

03:29.460 --> 03:33.800
And that's why it's a good idea to separate things such as names or anything that might be used as an

03:33.830 --> 03:37.390
individual piece of information or data in its own variable.

03:37.400 --> 03:41.980
So we've used first name and last name so let's run this and see what happens.

03:44.780 --> 03:45.450
OK.

03:45.740 --> 03:46.800
Down the bottom you have.

03:46.890 --> 03:47.660
Hi Tony.

03:47.730 --> 03:49.410
And dear Mr. Stanton.

03:49.570 --> 03:56.790
So piking uses the plus symbol to combine strings with variables we have just used the plus symbol to

03:56.790 --> 04:03.460
create a welcome message using the plus symbol to combine strings in Python is known as concatenation.

04:03.720 --> 04:04.700
Let's try another one.

04:06.380 --> 04:06.800
Print

04:11.120 --> 04:14.030
first name and last name.

04:14.360 --> 04:18.860
So again take your email program that might be welcome you might be a welcome message with your full

04:18.860 --> 04:19.340
name.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.270
So hi tony standard.

04:21.450 --> 04:23.080
And if we run this again.

04:23.610 --> 04:24.670
Oh OK.

04:24.950 --> 04:29.510
So down the bottom here you can see the full name has been printed but there's no space between a name.

04:29.510 --> 04:32.690
So where did the space go the space character.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.520
Like any other character needs to be added in.

04:35.940 --> 04:37.100
So let's do that.

04:37.440 --> 04:42.300
So we have first name actually let's just type a new line so we can do it again.

04:42.340 --> 04:48.750
Print first name plus.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.660
So instead of just going straight the last name we want to add in a space.

04:51.670 --> 04:58.720
So again we open for open and close with our double quotes type in a space and then add in our last

04:58.990 --> 05:05.040
name so let's run the US and there we have it.

05:05.060 --> 05:07.300
Tony standon Well a nice space.

05:07.310 --> 05:09.650
So going back to what we said it started this lecture.

05:09.650 --> 05:12.500
Concatenation means to combine things.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.920
So in Python it is.

05:13.990 --> 05:18.550
You use it to combine strings or strings with variables to make complete sentences.

05:19.490 --> 05:20.840
So I hope all of that makes sense.

05:20.930 --> 05:26.070
If not please don't hesitate to ask me in the Q and A section of this course and if it does keep going.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.400
Try the activities and I'll see you in the next lecture.

05:28.520 --> 05:28.830
Thank you.
