Hi everybody and welcome back the last lecture we looked at how to concatenate strings and variables

00:06.730 --> 00:09.760
or how to combine strings and variables.

00:09.760 --> 00:15.700
Now we used name in a name example in our last program lecture and how we're going to do and this lecture

00:15.700 --> 00:19.270
is we're just going to stick with this name example for a few more minutes.

00:19.510 --> 00:21.300
So just bear with me.

00:21.430 --> 00:29.740
So we have our name on our variable now as you can see here each time I typed my name I capitalized

00:30.130 --> 00:35.820
my first and my last name and I did that just out of habit.

00:35.960 --> 00:40.970
So let's just enter in a new variable first name.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.030
And again I use it just go like that.

00:44.120 --> 00:47.110
Capitalize But what happens if I don't.

00:47.420 --> 00:51.690
So there's no way for us to know how a user is going to type in their name.

00:51.800 --> 00:57.560
They could enter it in all caps all lowercase or they could capitalize the first initial of their name

00:57.920 --> 00:59.740
and let's just type in last name as well.

00:59.740 --> 01:00.500
Why were Alice

01:04.060 --> 01:05.070
so again.

01:05.090 --> 01:10.670
Imagine a program on the Web where you have asked a user for a first name and their last name but obviously

01:10.670 --> 01:15.740
when you print that name back to them you might want to capitalize their first or last initial whatever

01:15.740 --> 01:16.510
it might be.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.570
How do we do that.

01:17.780 --> 01:20.980
Well we use what's called the string title method.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.770
So the title medaled and that method looks like this.

01:24.770 --> 01:27.830
So we don't have to do anything to our current variables or the values.

01:27.860 --> 01:30.450
What we need to do is work on our print statement.

01:30.560 --> 01:40.540
So we have print and print our first name and then we followed up with Dot T I T L E.

01:40.830 --> 01:42.570
Open and close brackets.

01:42.720 --> 01:50.160
And that's called the piping title method and what that does is it capitalizes the first initial of

01:50.160 --> 01:50.870
this variable.

01:50.940 --> 01:53.880
So let's run this program and there we go.

01:53.880 --> 02:00.840
So as you can see our variable here Tony is all lowercase but when we printed out the screen Tony is

02:00.840 --> 02:04.850
now capitalized or at a T and Tony is now capitalized.

02:04.910 --> 02:06.930
That is very very handy.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.610
Saves you doing it allows you to take input from the user manipulate that input and print it out in

02:11.610 --> 02:13.510
a nice clean format.

02:13.530 --> 02:15.930
Now let's print out our first or our full name.

02:15.930 --> 02:23.940
But before we do let's just change the S and a t to lowercase and we just go down here and we say print

02:26.550 --> 02:29.080
name that.

02:29.370 --> 02:34.490
Print name that title opening close brackets and make sure you close your brackets here.

02:34.490 --> 02:36.350
And let's run this program again.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.220
And there we go.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.370
Perfect.

02:39.690 --> 02:45.600
Even though our name variable is all lowercase it's output it because of the title method in a nice

02:45.750 --> 02:50.080
cleanly formatted capitalized way.

02:50.090 --> 02:53.530
So let's just talk about this title method for a moment.

02:53.630 --> 02:58.760
This piece of information here t I t the open and closed brackets.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.270
That is what's known important as a method.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.070
So a method is an action that pipe and can perform on a piece of data.

03:05.240 --> 03:11.360
So in this example we've used the title method to manipulate the data within the name variable so to

03:11.360 --> 03:18.290
manipulate my name here or in your example your name and that manipulation has capitalized the T and

03:18.290 --> 03:21.200
the s dot after that name.

03:21.200 --> 03:26.460
Intertidal tells Python to make the title method act on the variable name.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.950
So no go just adding it in.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.270
You have to remember to put in the dash and adult with them.

03:31.270 --> 03:37.480
Tell Spuyten to use the title method on our variable name and equally when we use it on first name.

03:37.510 --> 03:43.190
Title told pite to use the title method on our first name and it would be the same with our last name.

03:43.410 --> 03:54.400
So print name last name and dush which tells Python to modify the last name variable with the title

03:55.020 --> 03:55.730
method.

03:56.890 --> 03:59.900
Let's run this again and there we have it.

03:59.980 --> 04:04.080
The standard has become the s in the stand and has become capitalized.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.000
A very very handy feature.

04:07.070 --> 04:11.000
Every method is followed by a set set of brackets opening and closing.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.290
Because methods often need additional information to do the work.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.790
This info is provided when in the brackets.

04:17.790 --> 04:22.650
So as we'll see later what in the brackets here we will provide more information for a method to work

04:22.660 --> 04:24.970
that could be user input could be anything.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.150
We'll look at that later.

04:27.050 --> 04:30.210
And that is an introduction into the python title method.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.890
We will look at other methods in future lectures.

04:33.030 --> 04:33.660
Thank you.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.830
I hope all this made sense.

04:34.830 --> 04:36.560
If not please ask me to Q&amp;A.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.210
Or check out the activity section.

04:38.310 --> 04:39.940
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
