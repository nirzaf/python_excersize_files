00:00.780 --> 00:06.180
Hi everybody and welcome back in the last lecture we looked at the title method which allowed us to

00:06.180 --> 00:10.060
capitalize the first letter of any string or any word.

00:10.160 --> 00:15.340
So as we know a method is an action that can come perform on any piece of data.

00:15.690 --> 00:18.890
So in this lecture we're going to look at pipings find method.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.800
So again we're still going to say with strings.

00:20.880 --> 00:25.630
So let's just enter in a string here and we start off with our opening and our closing quotes.

00:25.680 --> 00:36.290
So this string I'm going to enter is my favorite book is single quote because I want to emphasize the

00:36.290 --> 00:39.770
book name Elon Musk and if you haven't read it give it a go.

00:39.770 --> 00:43.040
It really is an excellent and a quick read.

00:43.070 --> 00:44.550
So here we have our strength.

00:44.840 --> 00:49.280
So let's just say again we have a program and it might have a search bar in it or a search function

00:49.280 --> 00:56.210
within it and we want to find where book is within our string or we might want to find where the word

00:56.530 --> 01:02.790
for it is within our string what we can do here is we can assign this first a variable.

01:02.810 --> 01:07.110
So let's just say my book equals.

01:07.170 --> 01:13.740
So now we have our variable on the left hand side and we have our value which is a string on a right.

01:13.820 --> 01:18.010
And what we do here now is we attach the find method

01:21.120 --> 01:26.410
OK seems simple enough but we have to tell it what we want to find.

01:26.430 --> 01:31.890
We just have empty brackets and as we said in The Last Lecture brackets are where you can place information

01:32.070 --> 01:36.320
of what you want to find method to do or any method to do so in this instance.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.610
We want to find book B.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.590
OK.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.590
OK.

01:40.860 --> 01:41.830
So there we go.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.040
So let's see what this does for us here and to get the information out to the screen.

01:46.050 --> 01:54.850
We have print my book let's run that perfect today.

01:54.910 --> 02:00.160
Now down here in the left hand side we can see that we got a return of 12 and why 12.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.710
Why not the actual workbook.

02:01.840 --> 02:06.410
Well obviously we need to first find where book is put in our strength.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.810
So here we have my favorite book.

02:08.880 --> 02:16.420
So what the 12 refers to is the position within our string where the word book starts.

02:16.420 --> 02:19.100
So when Spuyten counts it doesn't count.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.570
One two three four.

02:20.650 --> 02:22.240
Instead it starts at zero.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.440
So 0 1 2 3 4 and so on.

02:25.630 --> 02:30.260
And the reason Python starts at 0 is because it will on your computer language actually for that matter

02:30.310 --> 02:33.870
will start at zero is because it allows you to count backwards.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.990
So 0 minus one month to months minus four and so on.

02:37.990 --> 02:43.300
So you have that flexibility go forwards into positive numbers or backwards into negative numbers.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.610
So here we have here.

02:44.980 --> 02:50.950
My favorite book and if you were to count out you would see that B which is the start of book starts

02:50.950 --> 02:55.070
at position or as it's known in programming languages the index 12.

02:55.090 --> 02:56.470
And that's where the book starts.

02:56.470 --> 03:03.850
So equally we could change this and we could say instead of book we could say E-Loan and we can run

03:03.850 --> 03:13.000
this again and we get position 21 or index 21 position to index 21 OK.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.090
So how can this find method be used in the real world.

03:16.250 --> 03:21.410
Well as I mentioned at the start imagine this was a search program and you wanted to type in find Ilan

03:21.680 --> 03:24.560
it would be able to give you back what position Ilan is in.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.000
How many times E-Loan was mentioned in the search parameters or whatever might you might be.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.140
There are plenty of ways to expand on this Xon little method.

03:33.380 --> 03:39.590
Now Equally if you had a program and it was going back to an example an email program you could have

03:39.650 --> 03:40.750
a spam filter.

03:40.760 --> 03:45.310
So what you could make your program do is find characters that are associated with spam.

03:45.380 --> 03:55.220
So we could have subject as a variable equals and then the title over e-mail let's just say is get rich

03:55.980 --> 03:56.610
now.

03:56.830 --> 04:00.440
So I'm sure we've all got these kind of emails and we could have that find

04:07.630 --> 04:09.790
print subject.

04:10.180 --> 04:15.720
And let's see Amanda be and there we go.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.610
And this is interesting.

04:16.620 --> 04:18.460
We got the value back of zero.

04:18.630 --> 04:22.570
And as I just said Platon started counting at zero.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.210
Then it goes one two tree.

04:24.210 --> 04:32.130
So what this poll is telling us is that it found our search of three dollar signs in the very very beginning

04:32.340 --> 04:33.490
of our strength.

04:33.510 --> 04:34.330
So here we are.

04:34.410 --> 04:35.400
So here it is here.

04:35.560 --> 04:40.440
And what we could do later on is we could refine our e-mail program to remove any messages that it picks

04:40.440 --> 04:42.880
up as spam which is a three dollar signs.

04:42.900 --> 04:43.700
And this example.

04:43.740 --> 04:46.190
So that's a quick example of the find method.

04:46.680 --> 04:54.120
And as always as we've seen in our last lecture the find that starts with i n Andy brackets and inside

04:54.120 --> 04:58.440
the brackets is the argument that you want to pass on the information that you want to pass and applying

04:58.740 --> 05:01.680
for a method to act upon.

05:01.690 --> 05:03.020
So I hope that made sense.

05:03.130 --> 05:06.170
If not please shoot me a question on the Q&amp;A section.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.570
I gave the activities go at the end of the section thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
