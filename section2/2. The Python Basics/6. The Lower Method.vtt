Hi everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to continue our exploration of pipings methods

00:07.190 --> 00:09.680
and we're going to talk about the lower method.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.130
So what exactly does that mean.

00:11.130 --> 00:14.730
Well it's it does exactly what it says on the tin.

00:14.790 --> 00:16.860
So let's go back to our name example.

00:16.860 --> 00:23.040
So we have name and we're going to start for the opening closing double quotes.

00:23.040 --> 00:29.250
I don't to impart my name or as you type your name I'm going to put them in or Piquet's characters like

00:29.250 --> 00:29.560
this.

00:29.550 --> 00:36.020
Tony Stanton in upper case so let's assume someone has entered your name into your shiny new program

00:36.300 --> 00:38.440
and it's all in uppercase like this.

00:38.550 --> 00:43.470
Obviously we don't want to put that into a database or into our storage system which may be a file like

00:43.470 --> 00:43.810
this.

00:43.830 --> 00:48.960
We want it all the same because some people might enter their name in lowercase or capitalize the first

00:48.960 --> 00:50.940
initial like we saw in a previous example.

00:50.940 --> 00:56.010
So what we want going into our database has to be all the same and all the same formatted information

00:56.340 --> 00:59.070
so that we can use here is whitens lower method.

00:59.280 --> 01:06.130
So as we've seen with other methods we have dot o w e or opening close brackets.

01:06.130 --> 01:09.020
And what I will do now now it will lower the string.

01:09.050 --> 01:12.000
Tony and to all lowercase characters.

01:12.060 --> 01:13.430
So let's have a look at what we get.

01:13.460 --> 01:22.550
Print name and let's run this program control command and see if you run a Mac perfect reader.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.380
Here we have now down here in the bottom right Tony Staunton.

01:25.530 --> 01:32.010
All in nice lower characters cleanly formatted and ready to go into our database or any other file storage

01:32.010 --> 01:32.650
system.

01:32.940 --> 01:36.610
So that's a quick introduction into Python's lower method.

01:36.630 --> 01:41.330
To be honest it's one of my favorite because it's very useful and it's used all the time.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.890
I hope that was easy enough and I'll see you in the next lecture.

01:43.890 --> 01:44.200
Thank you.
