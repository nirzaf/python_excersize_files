Hi everybody and welcome back and this lecture we're going to be talking about Payton's replace method.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.150
So what does he actually does not do.

00:07.510 --> 00:13.300
Well it replaces a piece of a string with an earpiece so you can replace one word with another word

00:13.700 --> 00:14.340
and we'll look at that.

00:14.350 --> 00:15.220
Now in a moment.

00:15.340 --> 00:19.050
But first let me put this in some context for you in a real world example.

00:19.300 --> 00:25.810
We previously looked at the find method and what I did was find the position of a word within a string.

00:25.840 --> 00:32.620
So we had find a book and it told us that book started imposition 15 to what we could do is think of

00:32.720 --> 00:35.530
any word processing program you've ever used.

00:35.530 --> 00:38.120
There is always a Find and Replace function.

00:38.260 --> 00:40.590
So you could find a word and then replace the word.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.810
And this is exactly how it's done.

00:42.820 --> 00:44.590
So we previously saw how to find.

00:44.590 --> 00:46.410
Now we're going to see how to replace.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.640
So let's have a look at our Iran strength and what we're going to do here now is we're going to start

00:51.640 --> 00:52.870
off again with a variable.

00:52.870 --> 00:56.920
I'm going to call my book equals.

00:57.010 --> 01:03.160
And as always we start off with opening and closing double quotes and what we do here is we have my

01:04.120 --> 01:04.600
favorite

01:10.380 --> 01:18.550
book is a single quote because we want to give it emphasis and let's just say we spell this Ilan what

01:18.590 --> 01:23.050
a type of instead of Ilan we put Elon Musk.

01:23.130 --> 01:25.610
Easily done.

01:25.650 --> 01:29.920
So there's a string of what we want to do is replace.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.410
So we're using the pipe and replace method.

01:36.350 --> 01:39.630
Opening and closing brackets and we first put in the piece of the string.

01:39.650 --> 01:45.780
We want to replace two as previously we start with opening closing single quotes and we have Thielen

01:47.010 --> 01:50.500
then we have a comma to separate out our two pieces of information.

01:50.870 --> 01:52.470
Opening close and single quotes.

01:52.610 --> 01:55.270
And we put in what we want to replace it with.

01:55.280 --> 02:03.770
So we want to replace Eelam with Ilan and again go back to thinking about a word processor.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.910
You've made a typo and you've written a paper on the book.

02:06.910 --> 02:14.130
Elon Musk and all that paper you've misspelled Ilan for Ilan and you've done that 300 times.

02:14.170 --> 02:19.030
Now you get to find a Replace function within your word processor and this is how this is exactly how

02:19.030 --> 02:20.260
it works in the background.

02:20.260 --> 02:22.890
So let's run that and see what we get.

02:28.470 --> 02:31.230
And there we have it in the bottom left hand corner.

02:31.410 --> 02:36.840
Instead of getting my favorite book is Elon Musk We have my favorite book is Elon Musk.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.250
So it works perfectly.

02:38.340 --> 02:43.680
And that really is a very very helpful function if you're developing any kind of word processing email

02:44.070 --> 02:47.460
or any user input program because it's always going to be errors.

02:47.480 --> 02:54.000
Windows users involved so very easily we're able to replace our misspelt word with our correct word

02:54.470 --> 02:57.520
and nice little feature to keep on your list.

02:57.570 --> 02:58.890
So that's it for the replacement.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.050
I hope that made sense.

03:00.090 --> 03:03.650
If not please don't hesitate to ask me any questions in the Q and A section.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.470
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
