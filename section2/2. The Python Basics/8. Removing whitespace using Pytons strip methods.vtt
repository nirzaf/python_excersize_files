Hi everybody come back and back this lecture we're looking at Titans strep method.

00:06.190 --> 00:12.400
So the strip method removes any whitespace on the left or right hand side of your string.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.550
So let's take a look.

00:13.890 --> 00:18.910
So let's assume that you have a program running on the web and asks you to further address.

00:18.930 --> 00:21.850
So let's create our address variable.

00:22.470 --> 00:25.460
And as always I have left out the equal sign.

00:26.460 --> 00:33.540
And as always we have our opening closing double quotes and let's just say Our address is 101 Main Street.

00:34.650 --> 00:35.160
OK.

00:35.190 --> 00:40.860
And let's just print that out to our screen and see how it looks.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.110
Ok perfect as you can see down here on the bottom left.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.440
101 Main Street.

00:44.460 --> 00:45.660
Nothing wrong there.

00:45.660 --> 00:52.890
Now let's let's assume another user comes along and they enter in one or two main street.

00:53.080 --> 01:00.860
But for some reason they've also added in some tabs at the beginning and end of the string.

01:01.010 --> 01:05.910
And just to put this into a real world example I had a user once who couldn't log into our program because

01:06.180 --> 01:11.010
at the end of their email address they were putting in an extra whitespace that are hitting the space

01:11.010 --> 01:12.910
bar at the end of the e-mail address.

01:12.930 --> 01:17.630
I don't know why they were just doing it but the error was on my side because I didn't write in the

01:17.640 --> 01:22.540
code that picked up this little bit of extra whitespace and removed it from the e-mail address.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.530
So it was my fault.

01:23.700 --> 01:27.630
So this little matter we're going to look at now what have solved that problem.

01:27.690 --> 01:31.190
But before we get to that let's have a look at what we get on our output.

01:31.190 --> 01:36.540
So control and bait and here we are here down the bottom right down the bottom left sorry one or two

01:36.540 --> 01:41.810
main street and you can see here that our tarps have been added in.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.940
So obviously we don't want that going into our database or into our file.

01:46.040 --> 01:50.920
So we need to remove this whitespace and that's where pipelines strip method comes in.

01:51.170 --> 01:59.810
So at the end of address we have dot strip opening closing brackets and let's run that again.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.000
There we go perfect.

02:01.230 --> 02:03.460
All whitespace removed.

02:03.780 --> 02:05.060
Very very handy.

02:05.300 --> 02:08.310
So let's have a look at another example this time.

02:08.310 --> 02:15.030
Let's assume that they have left the whitespace in on the left hand side of their address.

02:15.180 --> 02:17.160
So just have been left here.

02:17.160 --> 02:24.300
We can modify strip to just be strip as in left strip and let's run that again.

02:26.090 --> 02:27.350
There we go.

02:27.470 --> 02:29.160
No whitespace.

02:29.270 --> 02:31.840
And again the same is true for the right hand side.

02:34.850 --> 02:38.750
So let's just add in some whitespace first to make sure that it's there.

02:40.230 --> 02:41.080
And print it out

02:44.810 --> 02:48.210
and on the right hand side we should see some whitespace yet there it is there.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.290
And let's modify our program again to remove the whitespace

02:56.260 --> 02:57.600
runs again.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.720
And as you can see no whitespace on the right hand side.

03:01.780 --> 03:04.880
So a very very handy set up for a set of methods there.

03:05.080 --> 03:19.570
And they are the strip method which removes all whitespace from your string the left strip method which

03:19.630 --> 03:26.120
as it sounds removes whitespace from the left hand side your string and or a strip method.

03:27.730 --> 03:30.940
Which removes whitespace from the right hand side of your string.

03:32.560 --> 03:37.390
And the real world these methods are very useful to clean cleaner user input and combined with everything

03:37.390 --> 03:42.910
that we've seen so far should help you to take user input strip it down clean it up and have it nicely

03:42.910 --> 03:44.940
formatted in your database.

03:44.980 --> 03:48.030
I hope that all of this made sense and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.

03:48.100 --> 03:48.580
Thank you.
