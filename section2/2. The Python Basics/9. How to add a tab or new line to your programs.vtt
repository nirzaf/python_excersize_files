Hi everybody and welcome back this lecture we're going to be talking about adding whitespace.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.190
So we've seen how remove whitespace.

00:08.190 --> 00:12.300
How about adding it back in such as a new line or a top.

00:12.390 --> 00:14.160
So I think it Hobba simple enough.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.370
And this is how you do it.

00:15.420 --> 00:18.410
That's Stigwood our dress.

00:18.800 --> 00:25.470
So we have a very big address equals opening closing double quote 101 Main Street.

00:25.980 --> 00:30.510
And then let's just say we want to add in the area where that might be such as the county or the city

00:31.800 --> 00:32.830
or the province.

00:32.970 --> 00:37.700
And let's just say if you're in Dublin like I am back slashed he adds in a tub.

00:37.830 --> 00:42.140
So you have backslid t Double-A and they just print our address

00:45.390 --> 00:47.310
and run that and there we go.

00:47.310 --> 00:51.950
Bottom left hand corner we can see our address 101 Main Street tab Dublin.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.130
Simple enough.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.710
Let's look at doing that with a new line.

00:55.710 --> 00:57.060
So again address

00:59.530 --> 01:08.260
equals opening closing double quote one or two Main Street and instead of adding in it time we want

01:08.260 --> 01:15.240
to add in a new line Dublin and let's just print Our address again.

01:15.370 --> 01:17.830
Print opening closing door brackets.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.000
Our address.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.680
Let's run that.

01:20.910 --> 01:24.270
And there we go one of two main street Doebbler.

01:24.330 --> 01:25.280
Perfect.

01:25.290 --> 01:30.390
So that's a very quick explanation as to how you add in a tab or a new line into your strings and your

01:30.390 --> 01:31.100
programs.

01:31.230 --> 01:33.050
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
