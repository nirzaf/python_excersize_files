Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.080 --> 00:06.540
Now we're moving into a new section now and this section is all about numbers in pite.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.470
So as you can see here I've moved into my ruby Id sort of Ruby interactive interpreter.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.120
And the reason I've done that is because we want instant feedback.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.130
I'm going to show you how to work with numbers in Python.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.090
So we're going to be adding subtracting what the playing.

00:19.110 --> 00:20.430
And we just want instant feedback.

00:20.430 --> 00:21.270
So we're going to look here.

00:21.270 --> 00:24.460
So when it comes to programming numbers are everywhere.

00:24.630 --> 00:28.970
Video games charts and graphs information stored analytics on and on.

00:29.010 --> 00:33.540
Numbers are absolutely everywhere and even in today's world I'm sure you've seen that numbers are even

00:33.540 --> 00:37.910
more important when it comes to big data big storage and things like that.

00:38.100 --> 00:42.610
So it really is valuable to get a good foothold in numbers in your programming language.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.570
So let's take a look at some quick examples.

00:45.600 --> 00:54.690
So pop open the interactive interpreter and try to following two plus two for straight away.

00:54.690 --> 00:55.860
Very simple.

00:55.860 --> 01:02.210
So what we just did was add two integer numbers and integers are whole numbers.

01:02.370 --> 01:03.810
Let's try another example.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.780
Five minus three.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.090
So.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.940
Try to perfect.

01:10.060 --> 01:15.530
And another example three times tree 9.

01:15.690 --> 01:17.070
Everything working as we expect.

01:17.070 --> 01:18.620
So now let's divide two numbers.

01:18.660 --> 01:24.330
So let's divide 6 by two and I'm leaving space in here between the characters.

01:24.330 --> 01:29.540
Just for clarity but you don't have to do that at so Six divided by two is three.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.250
Now what about exponents.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.890
So in Python exponents are represented by two multiplication symbols.

01:34.940 --> 01:48.810
So we have three sorry three exponent three twenty 27 over two five three thousand one hundred twenty

01:48.810 --> 01:49.200
five.

01:49.260 --> 01:49.970
Simple.

01:50.070 --> 01:54.720
And then as we get into a little bit more complicated little more structured number sequences.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.330
What about the order of operations.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.540
Well pite and supports those as well.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.170
So if we look at this example two plus

02:03.990 --> 02:07.230
three multiplied by four.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.780
And as I said you don't have to leave spaces between your number symbols.

02:12.780 --> 02:14.290
There you go 14.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.770
You can now use brackets to modify the order of operations.

02:17.820 --> 02:28.910
So let's have a look at dice.

02:29.070 --> 02:31.730
And here we go 20.

02:31.850 --> 02:36.350
So that's a very brief introduction into the numbering system an order of operations with implied in

02:36.700 --> 02:37.580
the next letter.

02:37.610 --> 02:40.650
We'll look at floats and what our floats would imply.

02:40.850 --> 02:42.950
Thank you and I look forward to seeing it in the next lecture.
