Hi everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be looking at floats in the piping language.

00:06.270 --> 00:09.000
So any number with a decimal point is called a float.

00:09.060 --> 00:10.200
And why is it called that.

00:10.380 --> 00:16.080
Well it's because a decimal point can appear at any position in a number plate and if any number in

00:16.080 --> 00:19.260
your calculation is a float then the result will be two.

00:19.260 --> 00:22.520
So let's take a look at some simple examples.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.280
One plus one point.

00:24.300 --> 00:25.110
Oh.

00:25.740 --> 00:26.790
Both have the same value.

00:26.830 --> 00:29.030
Let's have a look at the output 2.0.

00:29.090 --> 00:31.400
Perfect 2.0

00:34.660 --> 00:38.180
multiplied by 3.0 6.0.

00:38.320 --> 00:43.160
Perfect that's do division point zero.

00:43.190 --> 00:47.830
Divide it by 2.0 1.5.

00:47.830 --> 00:48.710
Very good.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.870
Sometimes you can get an arbitrary number of decimal places in your answer.

00:52.990 --> 01:00.490
And let's have a look at what that looks like 0.2 plus zero point 1.

01:00.490 --> 01:01.110
There we go.

01:01.150 --> 01:05.860
And that's just one of those things that pops up from time to time in Python and other programming languages.

01:05.860 --> 01:11.110
For the moment just ignore the extra decimal places and we're just gonna have to deal with them later.

01:11.470 --> 01:11.930
Thank you.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.660
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
