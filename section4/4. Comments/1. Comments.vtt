Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.040 --> 00:05.420
And this section we're gonna be talking about Common's would imply.

00:05.670 --> 00:11.010
So in any programming language there are what are known as comments and comments are in fantastic and

00:11.010 --> 00:14.510
very helpful tool in any language not just writing.

00:14.850 --> 00:16.590
So what exactly is a comment.

00:16.660 --> 00:22.260
A comment allows you to add plain English text to your programs and this tax will be ignored by the

00:22.260 --> 00:23.850
python interpreter.

00:23.970 --> 00:26.070
So comments are completely ignored by the computer.

00:26.070 --> 00:30.520
So you don't have to worry about them causing errors or upsetting your programs.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.340
And how do we write.

00:31.340 --> 00:35.490
Comments well implied in a comment begins with the hash symbol.

00:35.490 --> 00:40.090
This lets Platon know that everything after a comment is to be ignored.

00:49.860 --> 00:51.830
So let's look at a quick example.

00:59.990 --> 01:01.490
Let's enter in a comment.

01:01.520 --> 01:08.790
This is my hello world program and let's print out Hello World print

01:13.280 --> 01:15.040
open and close brackets.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.540
Hello world.

01:18.260 --> 01:25.570
And let's see what we guessed from our interpreter perfect bottom left hand side Hello world.

01:25.570 --> 01:30.610
So as you can see the two comments that we've included here are not output it onto your screen and are

01:30.610 --> 01:32.150
completely ignored by Peyton.

01:32.260 --> 01:38.590
So this leave you free to add in tips reminders and comments for programmers to help them when reading

01:38.590 --> 01:42.460
your programming as your programs become larger and more complicated.

01:42.460 --> 01:47.920
Comments are a great way for you to insert helpful notes about a piece of code or program because when

01:47.920 --> 01:52.630
you come back to it in a few months or a few years later you may not know why you wrote what you did.

01:52.630 --> 01:56.920
So going forward now in this course we're going to be adding in comments throughout our code.

01:56.920 --> 02:01.860
At the start of every program and then throughout our programs to give helpful pointers and reminders.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.580
Thank you and I see you in the next letter.
