Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.460 --> 00:06.650
Now we're moving into a new section and that section isn't titled lists.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.530
But before we jump into lists let's talk about a new concept for a few moments.

00:10.650 --> 00:16.560
And that concept is data structures a data structure is a collection of data elements such as numbers

00:16.620 --> 00:22.680
or characters that are structured in some way such as by numbering the the most basic data structure

00:22.710 --> 00:24.770
in Python is a sequence.

00:24.930 --> 00:30.960
Each element of a sequence is assigned a number its position or index or we've already discussed the

00:30.960 --> 00:33.060
first index start at zero.

00:33.060 --> 00:36.930
The second index is one and so on and so on.

00:36.930 --> 00:39.190
So let's just take a moment to talk about how numbers work.

00:39.210 --> 00:45.310
Once again in pite when you count things you most likely start counting at 1 in Python and then you

00:45.310 --> 00:46.400
add a programming languages.

00:46.460 --> 00:47.520
It's slightly different.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.100
You start counting at zero.

00:49.170 --> 00:53.310
One of the reasons for starting at zero as we've already discussed is because you can also come backwards

00:54.740 --> 00:57.470
Piven has six built in types of sequences.

00:57.470 --> 01:01.550
This section concentrates on one of the most common and that is Lists.

01:01.550 --> 01:05.620
Lists are one of Python's most powerful features and one of my favorite.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.640
So what exactly is a list.

01:07.640 --> 01:13.370
Well as we've already said it's a collection of items in a particular order the items in a list are

01:13.370 --> 01:14.600
called elements.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.910
You can make a list containing anything you want.

01:16.910 --> 01:22.730
Months of the year family names numbers absolutely anything because you will usually store more than

01:22.730 --> 01:23.990
one element in your list.

01:23.990 --> 01:26.820
It's a good idea when naming them to make the names plural.

01:26.870 --> 01:31.860
So just months names etc. when creating a list you start with the name of the list.

01:31.890 --> 01:34.250
So let's jump back into recoated are now and have a look.

01:35.890 --> 01:42.620
So as I've just said when creating a list you start with the names of the last month's equals.

01:42.750 --> 01:45.910
You don't start and end your list with square brackets.

01:46.020 --> 01:51.300
So let's open up square brackets and as you say close the square brackets individual elements of your

01:51.300 --> 01:54.080
list start and end with a single quote.

01:54.090 --> 01:57.550
So let's put in a month here and let's go with January.

01:59.130 --> 02:03.010
So as you can see we start and we close with single quotes.

02:03.120 --> 02:09.440
When you add additional elements to your list they are separated by a comma again opening closing single

02:09.440 --> 02:09.800
quotes

02:14.080 --> 02:14.870
that's in a month

02:18.030 --> 02:18.480
and another

02:21.630 --> 02:25.660
actually here I have left out a closing quote and we put that in.

02:25.950 --> 02:31.940
And as you can see our code has changed the font color of April.

02:31.950 --> 02:34.060
Now let's ask him to print out our list of months

02:44.110 --> 02:48.850
and as we have down the bottom left hand corner we can see our list of months January February March

02:48.970 --> 02:49.720
April.

02:49.720 --> 02:55.120
Now it's not very user friendly as we've already discussed elements in a list are numbered from zero

02:55.150 --> 02:56.140
upwards.

02:56.170 --> 03:00.040
This means that you can access each element individually like this.

03:00.040 --> 03:07.510
So let's have a look at another print statement and we go print months and because we're trying to access

03:07.510 --> 03:13.030
an element of a list we open with square brackets and we close with square brackets and we call the

03:13.030 --> 03:17.870
first element in our list which was January and it's our position 0.

03:17.890 --> 03:20.050
Now again let's print this.

03:20.240 --> 03:26.510
And as you can see in the bottom left the next line printed out is January.

03:26.660 --> 03:27.710
Not too bad.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.070
So that's a little bit more user friendly.

03:30.350 --> 03:32.880
What about capitalizing the first letter of the month.

03:33.260 --> 03:37.130
Well we can use what we did previously when trying to capitalize strings.

03:37.420 --> 03:41.320
So let's added this line and our code again and let's go print

03:44.890 --> 03:51.490
months and again we're accessing element 0 opening closing square brackets that title.

03:51.550 --> 03:53.990
And as always opening closing brackets.

03:54.160 --> 04:00.400
Now let's print this out and again we have a new line here and it's January with a capital J.

04:00.410 --> 04:01.990
Now that's nice.

04:01.990 --> 04:05.770
Now we have the first element in our list printed cleanly and capitalized.

04:05.920 --> 04:13.590
Accessing more than one element from our list to do that we can repeat our print statement print months

04:15.250 --> 04:15.970
we want to access.

04:15.970 --> 04:22.000
Now the second element in our list which is our position one and again we want to capitalize it that's

04:22.010 --> 04:23.470
printed and see how it looks.

04:23.490 --> 04:28.140
There we go January February and you can do that for all the elements in your list.

04:28.140 --> 04:32.380
Later on we look about doing this with one statement but for now this is how we're going to do it.

04:32.570 --> 04:33.030
Okay.

04:33.150 --> 04:37.560
So let's use what we've learned so far but taking one element from our list and putting it in a mess.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.140
Let's clear off what we have here.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.870
So let's get rid of this here but leave your list of months in place.

04:42.990 --> 04:56.010
So our message equals opening closing double quote I was born in leave a space closed or double quotes

04:56.430 --> 05:01.410
we are in the plus symbol for concatenation and we're adding in months and we're putting in position

05:01.950 --> 05:02.700
tree.

05:02.700 --> 05:08.380
So I was born in April and we want to capitalize April 1 I put to our screen

05:13.590 --> 05:16.690
and then we want to add in a full stop.

05:18.450 --> 05:24.320
Now I want to use double quotes there thought Now let's have a look at that print.

05:27.990 --> 05:30.130
Message.

05:30.420 --> 05:31.020
And there we go.

05:31.020 --> 05:31.980
Bottom left hand corner.

05:32.010 --> 05:33.710
I was born in April.

05:33.810 --> 05:34.590
Very very nice.

05:34.590 --> 05:40.620
So as you can see this can become very very powerful feature and it doesn't matter if you have one five

05:40.620 --> 05:42.900
ten or a million elements within your list.

05:42.990 --> 05:49.330
You can still store the same information and run the same programs on the lists in the next lecture.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.530
We'll look at changing adding and removing elements from our list.

05:52.530 --> 05:53.930
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
