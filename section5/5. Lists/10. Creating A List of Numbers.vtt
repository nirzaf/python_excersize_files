Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:03.150 --> 00:06.190
Now with this lecture we're going to look at creating a list of numbers.

00:06.330 --> 00:09.330
So I just started off as usual with some comments at the top.

00:09.420 --> 00:13.780
I'm going to look at how we can use the list function to convert a series of numbers into a list.

00:13.800 --> 00:18.990
So in the last lecture we saw that the range function simply prints out a series of numbers but we can

00:18.990 --> 00:22.340
use the list function to convert that series of numbers into a list.

00:22.350 --> 00:25.520
So let's have a look at that now and let's start off at a comment.

00:25.860 --> 00:30.950
Converting numbers into a list.

00:31.050 --> 00:31.490
Perfect.

00:31.530 --> 00:40.260
So numbers equals list open brackets range open brackets.

00:40.260 --> 00:42.460
And in this range let's place 1 to 6.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.980
And don't forget to close off with two closing brackets.

00:46.030 --> 00:51.150
Now print numbers.

00:51.400 --> 00:57.210
There we go a list of numbers so instead of the series we have a list 1 2 3 4 5.

00:57.430 --> 00:59.050
So we can do more with the range function.

00:59.290 --> 01:03.160
Let's print out a list of odd numbers between one on one hundred and one.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.500
So let's have a look.

01:06.180 --> 01:07.130
Odd numbers.

01:09.710 --> 01:11.450
Equals list

01:13.950 --> 01:14.890
range.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.390
One to One Hundred and One

01:22.230 --> 01:23.640
and Two and explain the two.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.030
Now in just a moment and let's print that out.

01:27.440 --> 01:35.360
Can print that out whatever my print statement so print odd numbers and there we go all odd numbers

01:35.450 --> 01:36.890
up to 100 in one.

01:37.100 --> 01:41.520
And in this example the range function starts at 1 and then adds two to us.

01:41.770 --> 01:44.900
So the last value we have in the range here is to.

01:45.110 --> 01:50.250
It adds to repeatedly until it reaches our pass at the end value of 101.

01:50.330 --> 01:53.940
The range function can be used to create almost any set of numbers that you want.

01:54.110 --> 01:57.730
Here's an example of how to create a list of the first 10 square numbers.

01:59.370 --> 02:04.920
So don't forget that in Python to act abstract symbols represent exponents and we saw that back when

02:04.920 --> 02:06.290
we started to put numbers.

02:06.330 --> 02:17.580
So let's create an empty list so squares equals an opening closing square brackets for value in range

02:18.790 --> 02:20.790
one to 11.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.370
And I forgot in my opening bracket there.

02:23.370 --> 02:30.750
So don't make that mistake to remove that space colon I used to always forget the colon so don't forget

02:30.750 --> 02:34.380
that and if you do get an error it's probably because you made a typo or you just left out the code

02:34.380 --> 02:36.780
on which is an easy thing to do.

02:36.840 --> 02:40.700
Square equals value.

02:40.930 --> 02:52.250
So the value in the range to 10 squares equals append Square.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.080
So all of this should be very familiar to you.

02:54.120 --> 03:00.830
Let's not go back to the previous lectures and have a look and then print squares.

03:00.830 --> 03:01.900
So let's have a look.

03:02.970 --> 03:03.930
Well we have an error.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.270
And where is our error.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.120
A pen is not defined.

03:07.430 --> 03:08.930
And why is a pen not the find.

03:09.020 --> 03:14.540
Well because I have an equal sign and as we know it doesn't work that way.

03:14.570 --> 03:19.540
So the Panthers are square and that should be that append.

03:19.580 --> 03:20.170
There we go.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.720
Let's have a look and there we go.

03:22.850 --> 03:27.340
In our third list we have a list of squared numbers 1 to 11.

03:27.470 --> 03:28.700
Not bad.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.380
So what else can we do with a list of numbers.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.490
Well let's create a new list.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.320
The IGY and let's call it less digits the IGY itx digits.

03:35.420 --> 03:39.940
And let's go one two three four five.

03:39.950 --> 03:40.720
Perfect.

03:40.730 --> 03:42.670
So there we have a list of digits.

03:42.740 --> 03:51.030
How about finding the minimum number in a list corrent minimum and mam's for short digits.

03:51.030 --> 03:55.370
T i g i t s have a look.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.110
There we go our last line here.

03:57.110 --> 03:59.850
Number one the minimum number in our list.

04:00.170 --> 04:02.070
What about the maximum.

04:02.370 --> 04:05.350
Let's just change minimum max and a x

04:08.770 --> 04:09.910
5.

04:09.910 --> 04:14.080
How about one more the sum.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.640
There we go 15.

04:15.660 --> 04:17.340
Some of the digits in our list.

04:17.370 --> 04:22.190
So that's been a brief introduction into a list of numbers and how we can use the range function.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.850
And for loops to manipulate them we'll come back to this topic again in future lectures.

04:26.850 --> 04:27.300
Thank you.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.830
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
