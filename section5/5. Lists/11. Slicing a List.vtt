Hi everybody and welcome back in the next couple of lectures we're going to look at how to work with

00:05.920 --> 00:08.020
specific parts of a list.

00:08.020 --> 00:12.670
So we've seen how to work through all the elements of a list but did you know that you can also work

00:12.670 --> 00:15.310
with a specific group of items within a list.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.790
Well no you didn't because I haven't explained that to you yet.

00:17.890 --> 00:23.110
And that's what this lecture is all about pite and caused this specific group a slice.

00:23.350 --> 00:27.930
So think of your whole list as a full pizza and we only want to work with part of that list.

00:27.970 --> 00:31.130
So we only want to work with one slice to make a slice.

00:31.150 --> 00:36.220
You specify the index of the first and last elements that you want to work with as with the range function

00:36.460 --> 00:41.320
pite and stopped one item before the last index you specify.

00:41.320 --> 00:45.180
So let's first create a list of names and then print out a specific group.

00:45.190 --> 00:46.440
So here's my list of names.

00:46.510 --> 00:47.400
You can create your own.

00:47.410 --> 00:49.120
I just copied this from an area lecture.

00:49.290 --> 00:51.360
But you can enter in any names that you want.

00:51.530 --> 00:53.890
So let's print out a specific group.

00:53.890 --> 01:01.440
So print and obviously we're working with the list name so print from named now open close square brackets

01:01.730 --> 01:03.270
0 to 2.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.770
And let's see what that gives us.

01:06.140 --> 01:08.020
It gives us Tony and Deirdre.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.690
So as we said stops before the last one so you would expect it to go 0.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.180
Tony 1 Deirdre to send.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.020
But it doesn't.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.680
It stops before the last number that we specified which was to which would be sent in.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.800
So it gives 0 1 what we wanted the middle two names from our list.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.920
Let's have a look at how we would do it at present.

01:28.550 --> 01:31.120
1 to 3.

01:31.130 --> 01:33.050
Don't forget your opening closing brackets

01:37.050 --> 01:40.660
that shouldn't be there and run well error.

01:40.650 --> 01:41.670
Where is that error.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.300
I didn't tell it what list to take it from.

01:44.410 --> 01:46.970
And we're taking it from names.

01:47.020 --> 01:47.790
There we go.

01:47.950 --> 01:52.790
Deirdre and Senate I hope you can understand these names or Irish names Deirdre and so on and so hope

01:52.790 --> 01:53.970
it makes sense to you.

01:54.310 --> 01:59.260
If you want to save yourself some time typing you can leave out the first index in a slice that will

01:59.260 --> 02:02.140
automatically start to slice at the start of your list.

02:02.170 --> 02:03.130
And how does that look.

02:05.300 --> 02:08.700
Print names.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.480
Open close square brackets COLANERI.

02:11.570 --> 02:12.480
What does that give us.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.110
Tony there just sent perfect.

02:16.150 --> 02:20.210
You can do something similar when you want to create a slice that includes the end of a list.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.790
So let's have a look.

02:21.790 --> 02:24.490
Print names.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.970
Open close square brackets to colon and run at 7.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.100
And Carol gives us the last two looks good looks good.

02:31.150 --> 02:37.240
This syntax allows you to output all of the elements from any point in your list to the end regardless

02:37.240 --> 02:38.580
of the length of the list.

02:38.590 --> 02:44.410
So it's very handy if we have a list of millions of users we could use print usernames or print names

02:44.800 --> 02:49.360
to call on clothes square brackets and that would tell us the last two people in the list.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.010
So it doesn't matter how big the list is.

02:51.010 --> 02:56.920
We can get the last two or last five or last 10 we've mentioned previously that a negative index returns

02:56.920 --> 02:59.760
an element a certain distance from the end of a list.

02:59.770 --> 03:03.410
So this means you can output on the slice from the end of a list.

03:03.460 --> 03:08.620
So what if we wanted to output the last tree named to read that a wretched for app where we go print

03:08.620 --> 03:09.110
names

03:12.040 --> 03:18.720
print names opening close square brackets minus tree color and let's see what that gives us.

03:19.770 --> 03:22.150
Lovely last three names that have registered.

03:22.230 --> 03:27.450
So there are some great ways to print out specific items from our lists in the next letter.

03:27.480 --> 03:32.130
We'll look at how we loop through a slice to make things even easier and quicker for yourselves.

03:32.370 --> 03:33.840
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
