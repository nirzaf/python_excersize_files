Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.820 --> 00:05.410
So the last lecture we looked at slicing a list.

00:05.460 --> 00:08.480
So in this lecture we're going to look at looping through that slice.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.400
So we make things even easier and more automated for you.

00:11.580 --> 00:13.710
So we kick off as always just with some comments.

00:13.890 --> 00:18.370
And as you can see the name of this program is looping through a slice and we'll continue now with another

00:18.420 --> 00:31.150
comment that will be looping through a slice with a sari with a for loop.

00:31.170 --> 00:31.930
There we go.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.590
So let's start off with our list of names which we need.

00:34.590 --> 00:42.480
So names equals square brackets Tony come up open causing single quotes.

00:42.480 --> 00:49.750
Frank comma Mary and Carl.

00:49.780 --> 00:50.590
There we go.

00:50.620 --> 00:51.530
List of names.

00:51.700 --> 00:52.250
OK.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.850
So we want to print these out or we want to print out a slice of them.

00:55.900 --> 01:00.350
So print open closing double quote.

01:00.470 --> 01:06.860
Here are the names of the last tree registrations.

01:07.460 --> 01:12.050
OK so let's imagine we have a web app and we have our own dashboard our own management system behind

01:12.050 --> 01:12.320
us.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.130
And we want to have a look at where we want to print to our screen every time we log in the last few

01:16.130 --> 01:17.550
registrations to our up.

01:17.570 --> 01:18.490
This is how that would work.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.120
And we have our FOR loop for name in names.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.010
OK.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.870
Now we're using our slice tree.

01:27.880 --> 01:33.820
The last tree registrations colon print open and closing brackets.

01:34.010 --> 01:38.090
Name that title opening closing brackets.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.580
Let's have a look.

01:40.580 --> 01:41.340
Boom.

01:41.540 --> 01:42.890
Very very nice.

01:42.890 --> 01:46.280
Here are the names or last tree registrations Tony.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.760
Frank Mary and all capsulizes as well.

01:48.770 --> 01:53.900
So a nice little piece of code there that you can use in your programs to loop through names or the

01:53.900 --> 01:58.560
last few items in a list or whatever it might be doesn't even matter how big the list is.

01:58.860 --> 01:59.290
OK.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.650
So I hope you found that enjoyable and I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:01.730 --> 02:02.210
Thank you.
