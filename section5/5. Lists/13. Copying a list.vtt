Hi everybody and welcome back this lecture we're going to talk about how to copy a list.

00:04.930 --> 00:08.800
So there are various reasons why you might want to copy a list might want to make a copy because you

00:08.800 --> 00:10.060
don't want to alter the original.

00:10.090 --> 00:12.200
You might be making a back up whatever it is.

00:12.310 --> 00:14.610
This lecture is going to show us how to do it.

00:14.920 --> 00:20.440
So to copy a list you create a slice that includes the entire original list.

00:20.550 --> 00:23.040
So it's a full slice of the original list.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.280
You can create a slice by omitting the first and second index.

00:26.520 --> 00:31.230
And by doing this you are telling Python to make a slice that starts at the first item and ends with

00:31.230 --> 00:31.950
the last.

00:31.950 --> 00:33.930
So let's take a look at how that's done.

00:33.930 --> 00:36.370
First we create our list names.

00:36.390 --> 00:42.560
Equals open closing square brackets opening quote opening closing single quotes Tony.

00:42.810 --> 00:50.770
Frank just put that in there if I wanted to work.

00:50.780 --> 00:59.630
Mary Mark Mary and Carl perfect.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.450
We have a list now.

01:01.950 --> 01:06.900
Let's create a new variable called first names because obviously these names are first names first names

01:07.950 --> 01:09.250
he calls names.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.580
So we're going to work on the names list.

01:11.580 --> 01:20.840
And as I said we leave out the first and second index and we just put in a colon let's print first names

01:21.050 --> 01:22.590
and let's have a look at what we get.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.160
We should get our full list

01:27.210 --> 01:28.460
perfect.

01:28.470 --> 01:33.750
Now we have a copy of our list which we can address and perform manipulations on without affecting the

01:33.750 --> 01:34.780
original list.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.560
A very very handy piece of code.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.140
Thanks for listening and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
