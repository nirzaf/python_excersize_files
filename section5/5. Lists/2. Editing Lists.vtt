00:00.510 --> 00:02.000
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.260 --> 00:05.760
Now so far we've created a very simple list of months.

00:05.970 --> 00:10.800
But as you start to write bigger and more complex programs your list will need to be more dynamic more

00:10.800 --> 00:16.580
flexible which means that you will want to create lists and then add remove and elements as your program

00:16.580 --> 00:22.290
is running that's create a new list one that stores the birthday months of friends and family.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.590
So here we go as always.

00:23.610 --> 00:34.160
Let's start off our name birthday months and that equals and let's just add in a few days a few months

00:34.160 --> 00:35.920
of birthdays of friends and family.

00:35.930 --> 00:47.910
So April as always opening closing single quotes comment to separate out the elements May and November.

00:48.010 --> 00:49.100
Okay perfect.

00:49.140 --> 00:52.820
Let's just print out our list just to make sure everything's working

00:59.460 --> 01:00.030
and there we go.

01:00.030 --> 01:04.680
Bottom left hand corner there is a list formatted that.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.990
Now let's imagine that we've made a typo when spelling April so instead of spending April with an A.

01:10.010 --> 01:12.460
We spelt it with an S Sproule.

01:13.210 --> 01:13.780
OK.

01:13.850 --> 01:15.610
And again we'll print this out.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.920
OK and here we can see in the bottom left hand corner our typo.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.210
In April instead of a we've got an S.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.560
How do we change the value of this first element to correct a typo.

01:25.700 --> 01:29.210
Well we could just remove this here altogether.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.860
But let's imagine we're in a program running.

01:32.030 --> 01:38.820
What we need to do is we need to modify the first element of this list and to do that we use the change

01:38.820 --> 01:43.780
method you can use this method to change any element of a list and not just the Force One.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.760
So we're going to use it here and the first one but you can use it for other elements in the list by

01:47.760 --> 01:50.020
simply replacing the index number.

01:50.100 --> 01:58.620
So let's have a look at the months on we want to change position 0 because that's April equals.

01:58.850 --> 02:03.610
And now let's put in our correct spelling of April and because we haven't put a new print line we still

02:03.610 --> 02:04.460
get her.

02:04.630 --> 02:10.930
We still get our misspelled April let's put in a new print line and let's run it again.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.010
And there we go.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.500
So you can see our first list has our April with a spelling mistake on our second is corrected.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.390
Not too bad.

02:19.990 --> 02:22.560
Now let's add an element to our list.

02:23.420 --> 02:27.200
So we've just made a new friend and you want to add their money to your birthday list.

02:27.260 --> 02:28.220
How we do that.

02:28.410 --> 02:31.330
Well we use what's called the append method.

02:31.400 --> 02:39.930
So again we access our list birthday months we go does a p p e n d and then we'll in the brackets open

02:39.960 --> 02:42.650
closing single quotes and we put in the month that we want to add.

02:42.680 --> 02:47.510
So in this case let's say June and then we once again we print out our month's

02:50.390 --> 02:56.300
rent a month and we run that and now we can see in the bottom left hand corner our list now has one

02:56.300 --> 02:57.270
additional month.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.920
June.

03:00.090 --> 03:01.800
So what happens if you have no friends.

03:01.910 --> 03:04.630
You just arrive in a new town and you've no Birdie's to add to your list.

03:04.860 --> 03:14.140
Well you can create an empty list just like this so Birthday months equals a space that is to make it

03:14.250 --> 03:15.160
easier to read.

03:15.330 --> 03:17.820
Equals opening closing square brackets.

03:17.820 --> 03:21.390
Now we have an empty list so let's print that as

03:26.680 --> 03:31.680
perfect as you can see now our line of output here is moving through all our work.

03:31.960 --> 03:37.030
And the last piece here the last line here is an empty list called Birthday months.

03:37.060 --> 03:41.200
But now you've made a friend and you want to add their birthday month to your list.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.170
How do you do it.

03:42.490 --> 03:47.890
Well the append method works just as well on an empty list as it does with a list that already has elements

03:47.950 --> 03:48.610
in it.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.890
So let's take our birthday list again.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.330
Birthday months.

03:52.390 --> 04:00.550
Pand again opening closing brackets opening closing single quotes a U G U S T.

04:00.550 --> 04:02.460
So your new friend was born in August.

04:02.890 --> 04:08.710
Let's print this out again.

04:09.420 --> 04:14.400
Perfect August has now been added to our list of birthday months so most of your programs are going

04:14.400 --> 04:18.330
to start off in an empty list because after all you don't know what date or your users will want to

04:18.330 --> 04:22.370
store the append method as an element to the end of a list.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.920
But what if you want to add a new element to a specific position in your list.

04:26.130 --> 04:31.140
Well let's take a look so at the moment we've got one month August in our list.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.570
But now we've made yet another friend.

04:32.610 --> 04:35.220
We're on a roll and their birthday is in May.

04:35.220 --> 04:38.020
How do you add this month to your list before August.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.740
Because August is already in there.

04:39.840 --> 04:45.930
What you can do so by using the insert method you can use the insert method by set by specifying the

04:45.930 --> 04:48.680
index of the new element and its value.

04:48.690 --> 04:54.280
So let's again take our birthday months so Birthday months.

04:54.360 --> 05:03.550
Insert as we said before when using a method in python you have dot and then the method name followed

05:03.550 --> 05:05.200
by brackets.

05:05.200 --> 05:10.900
So here we have done insert and we want to put this into position 0 which is the first position in their

05:10.900 --> 05:11.430
list.

05:13.050 --> 05:18.440
Comma and then opening closing single codes like before and closing brackets.

05:18.510 --> 05:21.450
Now let's print out our birthday month list

05:25.030 --> 05:25.780
and there we go.

05:25.810 --> 05:31.240
Our last line may August perfect so we're doing well.

05:31.300 --> 05:35.590
We're making friends and we're adding them to our list so we've discussed changing adding elements to

05:35.590 --> 05:36.190
a list.

05:36.190 --> 05:37.300
Now what about removing them.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.500
So we've just found out what a friend.

05:38.530 --> 05:42.650
OK so we're not doing too well we've just found that one of our two friends no longer want to remember

05:42.650 --> 05:43.260
it apparently.

05:43.330 --> 05:44.890
How do you remove it from your list.

05:44.920 --> 05:50.530
Well we use the lead statement and let's have a look at that in operation using the delete statement

05:50.670 --> 05:54.890
you can remove an item from any position in the list so long as you know its index.

05:54.910 --> 06:00.580
So let's delete the birthday month let's delete position 1.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.180
So we want to take out August

06:05.290 --> 06:06.950
let's print out our birthday once again

06:10.140 --> 06:10.850
and there we go.

06:10.860 --> 06:15.820
Now a list of birthday months only contains one month and that may.

06:15.980 --> 06:18.050
OK so now we move forward into a list.

06:18.060 --> 06:22.680
We've seen how to change add and remove elements in the next letter that will continue on with our learning

06:22.680 --> 06:23.490
of lists.

06:23.670 --> 06:27.180
I will dive much deeper in with some new methods and new functions.

06:27.180 --> 06:27.660
Thank you.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.220
I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
