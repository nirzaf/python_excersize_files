Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.950 --> 00:06.240
Now this just a quick lecture to catch up on something that I said I would do in a previous lecture

00:06.300 --> 00:09.570
but then promptly forgot which I often do.

00:09.630 --> 00:13.010
We're going to add in some comments to the code we wrote in our previous lecture.

00:13.020 --> 00:17.640
So what I have here is the code from our last lecture which is our birthday months and let's just start

00:17.640 --> 00:18.340
off at the top.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.650
So we're just going to put in

00:22.570 --> 00:34.560
and we're just going to put in today's day 24 of the 10th 2016 and for American friends you can write

00:34.560 --> 00:38.650
that the way where you're going to put in some more comments here.

00:39.240 --> 00:47.670
And we're just going to put it in the author which is me Tony Stuart I'm just going to play in the name

00:47.670 --> 00:48.290
of our program

00:51.110 --> 01:05.870
and we're going to say anything less or we should say how do you know how to edit lists OK.

01:05.870 --> 01:11.790
Now let's move down to our code and let's have a sort of first line was in months and we created a list.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.240
So let's add uncomment here

01:16.230 --> 01:21.010
creating a list of months.

01:21.090 --> 01:22.110
Perfect.

01:22.110 --> 01:23.040
Now our next line

01:26.480 --> 01:28.030
was printing

01:30.790 --> 01:31.690
our list.

01:31.860 --> 01:34.890
Now just a quick note on comments here.

01:34.920 --> 01:39.180
You don't want to be overzealous with your comments so you don't have to comment absolutely everything

01:39.390 --> 01:40.710
because it's a beginner's course.

01:40.710 --> 01:45.300
I'm just going to write a comment on the print statement but for experienced programmers comment here

01:45.510 --> 01:46.830
is probably not necessary.

01:46.920 --> 01:58.190
And then the next piece of code where you have changing an element E.A. of our list.

01:58.530 --> 01:59.230
Perfect.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.730
I won't come into print statement here because we've already done that previously.

02:02.730 --> 02:10.610
Now next comment using the append method.

02:10.950 --> 02:12.380
Perfect.

02:12.410 --> 02:14.840
Again we won't comment the print statement.

02:15.420 --> 02:27.000
We'll add in the comment here and that comment is creating an empty list.

02:27.220 --> 02:28.450
The next piece our comment.

02:28.450 --> 02:31.300
Well we've already used the append method.

02:31.450 --> 02:39.090
So we'll just keep going down and we'll add in a comment here and we'll say using the insert method

02:44.500 --> 02:45.230
excellent.

02:45.310 --> 02:54.700
And then finally we have our delete statement and we'll just adding a comment here using the delete

02:58.020 --> 02:59.800
statement.

03:00.150 --> 03:02.900
Perfect.

03:02.930 --> 03:08.330
So now when somebody reviews this code or if we were to send it on to somebody they would know when

03:08.330 --> 03:11.810
the code was written who was written by and what the name and program is.

03:11.990 --> 03:16.490
And wrote our code then we have a set of let We have a set of comments which tells people what each

03:16.490 --> 03:18.420
section of code does.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.730
Now as you learn more and your knowledge of Python increased You may not have to common that you may

03:22.730 --> 03:27.660
not have to make such obvious comments but because we're all beginners here it's necessary but we'll

03:27.680 --> 03:29.440
adapt as we learn and move forward.

03:29.570 --> 03:30.970
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
