00:00.540 --> 00:02.440
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.490 --> 00:07.140
Now previously we worked a list called Birthday months where we store them on our friends and families

00:07.140 --> 00:11.750
birthdays the Munsen this list can and did appear in any order.

00:11.770 --> 00:13.670
So let's just take a normal list of birthday months.

00:13.740 --> 00:17.450
But before we do that let's add in some comments.

00:17.490 --> 00:18.390
So today's date

00:21.070 --> 00:28.630
24th of October 2016 followed by the author which is me and it's going leave it or the name is going

00:28.630 --> 00:30.920
to write in is daunting because I know who I am.

00:31.050 --> 00:33.860
Followed by the program name.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.190
This is organizing a list.

00:38.640 --> 00:39.090
OK.

00:39.090 --> 00:39.860
Perfect.

00:40.050 --> 00:49.090
Now so let's just create a list and let's start off the comment again creating a list of months.

00:49.290 --> 00:50.170
Perfect.

00:50.190 --> 00:51.910
And let's now do that.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.390
So a birthday month equals that's open and close or square brackets.

00:58.410 --> 01:02.340
Let's start in close with a single quote and let's go.

01:02.370 --> 01:09.970
May come up opening closing single quote November and that's adding one more which can be.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.800
June Judis as you can see are in complete random order.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.810
So let's have a look.

01:15.090 --> 01:18.990
So how can we go about sorting these now using some of pipings methods.

01:19.290 --> 01:22.730
Well Peyton sort method makes it pretty simple to sort a list.

01:22.800 --> 01:28.990
So what we can do is we can take our list which has birthday months and we can apply the sort method.

01:29.010 --> 01:32.650
So does sort then we can print it out.

01:32.650 --> 01:37.050
Print birthday months and let's print that.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.990
So that's sort of them alphabetically.

01:38.990 --> 01:44.060
You can also sort a list in reverse alphabetical order by passing the argument reverse equals truth

01:44.300 --> 01:45.360
to the sort method.

01:45.380 --> 01:46.870
So let's see how we do that.

01:47.080 --> 01:58.190
And it's out in a comment using the reverse sort method and how do we do that.

01:58.210 --> 02:03.190
Well we take our bird months so let's just take this list here copied and pasted.

02:03.220 --> 02:03.780
There we go.

02:03.780 --> 02:08.030
Birthday months and let's go.

02:08.050 --> 02:18.940
Birthday month sort of that sort of reverse equals true with a capital T.

02:18.940 --> 02:23.830
Now let's print out a month's print birthday months.

02:24.890 --> 02:26.540
Okay perfect.

02:26.560 --> 02:32.010
So you can see our first list here has all of them alphabetically and you can see our next list has

02:32.020 --> 02:34.740
reversed that so reverse alphabetical order.

02:34.780 --> 02:35.740
Perfect.

02:35.770 --> 02:36.850
So a good start.

02:36.850 --> 02:39.000
So two ways to sort lists right there.

02:39.960 --> 02:46.150
Now any time we use either of these methods to sort of to sort reverse our list are permanently altered.

02:46.290 --> 02:51.120
So that means we can no longer but go back to the original format of the list or the original order

02:51.210 --> 02:52.320
of the list.

02:52.530 --> 02:58.510
But you can temporarily sort of list using the sorted method s.o. or TPD.

02:58.530 --> 02:59.820
So how do we use that.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.170
Well let's create a new list now so we can see.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.700
So we'll use Berty months again and paste it in.

03:05.940 --> 03:09.960
And then what we will say is print sorted

03:13.200 --> 03:20.920
birthday months OK and let's run up up next there we go the list is sorted alphabetically as it was

03:20.920 --> 03:22.430
in our very first example.

03:22.830 --> 03:26.880
But in the first example that list is now permanently sorted in our nesting.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.680
In this example it's only temporarily sorted.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.490
So let's see if we print it again.

03:31.570 --> 03:36.560
Print birthday months.

03:36.980 --> 03:37.940
There you go.

03:37.970 --> 03:42.050
You can see now that the list has reversed has reverted to its original order.

03:42.230 --> 03:45.310
So when you want to apparently order a list use a sort for.

03:45.320 --> 03:51.920
Use the sort methods and when you want to temporarily organize a list use the sorted method.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.670
Now one final way to sort a list is in reverse.

03:54.740 --> 03:56.270
So what is reverse.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.120
Because we've seen alphabetical and we've seen reverse alphabetical.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.230
Well reverse is exactly that.

04:01.250 --> 04:04.560
It's the list exactly in reverse order.

04:04.850 --> 04:07.040
So let's see how we can do that actually for this.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.500
Let's create a new list.

04:08.520 --> 04:17.870
So let's have birthday days equals opening closing square brackets open closing single quote.

04:18.110 --> 04:19.020
So let's go Monday

04:21.700 --> 04:22.250
Tuesday

04:25.550 --> 04:26.930
Wednesday.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.480
Thursday and Friday.

04:35.470 --> 04:35.920
OK.

04:35.950 --> 04:38.740
So that's the days of the week obviously in perfect order.

04:38.740 --> 04:39.930
Now let's reverse them.

04:40.060 --> 04:52.450
So birthday months sorry birthdays that reverse and print birthday days and let's have a look at what

04:52.450 --> 04:53.490
we get.

04:53.500 --> 04:59.680
Perfect Friday Thursday Wednesday Tuesday Monday so our list exactly in reverse order so I hope you

04:59.680 --> 05:01.540
found that helpful as you can see.

05:01.540 --> 05:06.370
There are several ways to easily and quickly organize a list in Python and I'll come back to this in

05:06.370 --> 05:07.330
future lectures.

05:07.330 --> 05:08.040
Thanks for listening.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.580
I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
