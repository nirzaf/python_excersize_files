Hi everybody and welcome back and this delightfully short lecture we're going to be looking at how to

00:04.620 --> 00:07.820
count the number of items put in one of your lists.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.890
So as you can see here I have started off with at least 30 days from our last lecture I want I'm going

00:12.900 --> 00:15.750
to do is just add in some quick comments.

00:16.590 --> 00:18.080
So I'm going to add in today's date

00:20.900 --> 00:28.850
25th of October 2016 and just let me spaced that out so it's nice and clean.

00:28.980 --> 00:35.870
Next myself of the author and then the name of this program

00:39.050 --> 00:44.530
how to find the length of a list.

00:44.870 --> 00:45.300
OK.

00:45.320 --> 00:45.910
Perfect.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.390
So we have a list here which I took from our last letter.

00:49.410 --> 00:50.330
You can do the same.

00:50.430 --> 00:59.350
And I'm just going to add in a comment list of days of the week probably unnecessary as it's very very

00:59.350 --> 01:05.320
obvious what this is but nonetheless just do it because I like putting comments in for clarity.

01:05.350 --> 01:10.270
Now we mentioned earlier that when dealing with list you can be dealing with hundreds of thousands if

01:10.270 --> 01:11.660
not millions of items.

01:11.710 --> 01:16.750
So Soltani of pite and to provide us with a way of quickly and easily finding the length of a list by

01:16.750 --> 01:25.020
using the length function which looks like this perfect as we get more and more friends and other birthday

01:25.020 --> 01:25.800
months to our list.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.770
It would be handy to know how many elements are in it.

01:28.890 --> 01:31.770
So how do we apply the length function to our list.

01:31.860 --> 01:33.360
Well let's have a look.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.860
We start off with a simple print statement print open and close brackets.

01:37.950 --> 01:42.890
And we then open bracket and pass it the name of the list we want to count.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.540
So in this case it's birthday days.

01:46.620 --> 01:47.070
There we go.

01:47.070 --> 01:52.380
Make sure you have two closing brackets here and let's print that and they have a bottom left hand side

01:52.660 --> 01:53.170
five.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.950
So there are five days of the week in our list.

01:56.180 --> 01:56.530
OK.

01:56.550 --> 02:01.770
Let's add in the weekend day Saturday and Sunday.

02:02.120 --> 02:06.150
And I've left out the opening single quote and I'll disclose that.

02:06.150 --> 02:06.690
There we go.

02:06.700 --> 02:09.450
Comma separated out and Sunday.

02:10.470 --> 02:11.180
Perfect.

02:11.310 --> 02:13.080
Run our program again.

02:13.080 --> 02:13.600
There we go.

02:13.620 --> 02:18.520
Seven nice quick easy lecture on how to find a number of elements in any list.

02:18.630 --> 02:20.100
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
