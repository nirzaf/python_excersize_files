Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.980 --> 00:06.780
We're moving into a new section now and that section follows on from the last and it's numerical lists.

00:06.780 --> 00:11.820
So in today's world you hear a lot about big data the ability to crunch an incomprehensible amount of

00:11.820 --> 00:12.660
information.

00:12.660 --> 00:18.960
Providing us with invaluable insights we wouldn't otherwise have fundamentally big data is less massive

00:18.960 --> 00:23.890
amounts of information unless to be analyzed we've looked at list containing strings.

00:24.030 --> 00:31.920
But what about numerical lists such as scores data bank balance details distances populations and countless

00:32.010 --> 00:38.290
other numerical lists pite provide a number of tools to help us work with list of numbers and the great

00:38.290 --> 00:42.750
thing is once you understand how to use these tools they'll work just as well with a list of millions

00:42.750 --> 00:47.460
of items as they do with a list of just a few dozen isn't pite and just great.

00:47.460 --> 00:51.230
So let's play one into the next lecture and get started with our numerical lists.

00:51.270 --> 00:52.230
I'll see you in the next lecture.
