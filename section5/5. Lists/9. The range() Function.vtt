Hi everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to kick off our section on numbered lists.

00:07.330 --> 00:12.550
I'm going to start with the range function so you can use this function to generate a list of numbers.

00:12.610 --> 00:17.050
So as you can see to get us started I've just entered in some comments to date the author and the name

00:17.050 --> 00:23.410
of the program the range function we're going to add in one more comment here to get us started using

00:25.210 --> 00:28.840
the range function.

00:28.840 --> 00:29.800
Perfect.

00:29.800 --> 00:38.300
So our first line for value in range 1 to 5.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.880
So this code should be very familiar with you.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.020
Now obviously the first thing you should notice is that it's a for loop.

00:45.020 --> 00:47.380
If you haven't noticed that or if this is unfamiliar to you.

00:47.390 --> 00:50.260
Go back to the last lecture and have a review.

00:50.300 --> 00:55.130
Our next line obviously is indented because when we have a for loop which is close to the colon your

00:55.130 --> 00:57.830
editor will usually indent the line for you.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.850
So print value

01:03.830 --> 01:04.440
perfect.

01:04.460 --> 01:07.650
Now you would think that the output would be 1 2 3 4 5.

01:07.820 --> 01:12.980
And if you did think that you were wrong because in this example the range function prints the numbers

01:13.070 --> 01:13.910
1 through four.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.880
So you can see it here in the bottom left 3:59 the range function starts counting at the first value

01:20.120 --> 01:24.980
which is 1 and then stops when it reaches the second last value because it stops at the second last

01:24.980 --> 01:29.830
value the output never contains the end number which in this case would have been 5.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.840
So if I change five to six and run it again which on the Mac is controlled and be commanded be sorry.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.370
I get one two three four five.

01:37.480 --> 01:41.440
So that's a quick introduction into the start of this section which is numerical lists and using the

01:41.440 --> 01:44.810
range function to Karaite on the range of numbers that you want.

01:44.830 --> 01:49.110
And the next lecture we're going to be talking about creating a list of numbers so I'll see you there.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.770
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
