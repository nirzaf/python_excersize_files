Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:04.830 --> 00:09.240
Now the first thing you're going to notice about this lecture is I have a new interface running so I'm

00:09.240 --> 00:11.290
using platens idle interpreter.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.890
So that's development environment provided by Python itself.

00:13.890 --> 00:18.780
When you install Python so if any of this is unfamiliar to you or you don't know how to get this interpreter

00:18.780 --> 00:19.700
open running.

00:19.710 --> 00:25.140
Please go back to the introduction sections and have a look there for the lecture on using Idol and

00:25.140 --> 00:29.490
the reason I switch into Idol is because as you've seen in the last lectures I was using the Sublime

00:29.490 --> 00:33.090
Text Editor but sublime does not let us use input statements.

00:33.090 --> 00:35.540
And that's what this lecture is all about.

00:35.550 --> 00:39.080
So in future lectures we're going to be discussing what's called branching and conditions.

00:39.120 --> 00:44.370
But before we get there I want to discuss Python's import function and that function looks like this

00:44.700 --> 00:47.860
in part opening close brackets.

00:47.970 --> 00:51.660
So let's look at simple example of a welcome message.

00:51.660 --> 01:00.540
So welcome equals input and then we place our argument inside or what we want the input method to show.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.850
Welcome What's your name.

01:07.860 --> 01:12.900
When we leave space there and we come back we close it up a quote and it becomes a bracket's perfect

01:13.050 --> 01:14.130
except for the input function.

01:14.130 --> 01:18.480
All of this should be very familiar to the purpose of the input function is again something from the

01:18.480 --> 01:18.960
user.

01:19.020 --> 01:23.380
In this case the users name it could be anything a password email address a phone number.

01:23.460 --> 01:27.260
And I think your program is paused until a user enters something.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.570
So let's run this.

01:28.730 --> 01:33.630
And unlike sublime which saves automatically before you can run a program in idle you have to save it.

01:33.810 --> 01:35.180
So let's just say it is.

01:35.580 --> 01:36.450
There we go.

01:36.450 --> 01:39.270
And then when you go up here run module

01:42.460 --> 01:43.900
welcome what's your name.

01:43.900 --> 01:47.000
So this is the pipe module Don't worry about it for the moment.

01:47.020 --> 01:47.650
What's your name.

01:47.650 --> 01:48.790
My name is Tony.

01:48.850 --> 01:49.330
OK.

01:49.330 --> 01:51.770
The takes in our name but it doesn't output anything.

01:52.630 --> 01:53.690
That's OK for the moment.

01:53.740 --> 01:57.860
Once it receives the user's input it is then stored in a variable for you to use later.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.230
So as we can see here our import is asking us what's our name and that information that's imported by

02:02.230 --> 02:07.210
the user such as your name will be stored in a variable welcomed the input function takes one argument

02:07.390 --> 02:09.730
which is whatever you want to display to the user.

02:09.760 --> 02:13.710
In our case the argument in this example is what is your name.

02:13.750 --> 02:18.320
Our program then wait while the user enters the name and continues after the user presses enter the

02:18.320 --> 02:19.640
response from the user.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.770
The name is stored in the variable welcome.

02:22.840 --> 02:29.000
So let's put what we get into the variable Welcome to the screen print Hello

02:32.780 --> 02:35.900
close or double quotes plus welcome.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.590
So we've seen this before.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.480
Okay perfect.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.500
And let's run this again.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.400
So first we have to save us coopting the top menu.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.180
Run.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.320
Module.

02:46.350 --> 02:47.780
So what's your name.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.130
Tony hello Tony.

02:50.130 --> 02:54.510
Perfect flight now takes user input and output to the screen.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.460
Let's extend our program slightly and add in the title.

02:58.530 --> 03:01.140
So welcome that t i t l e.

03:01.320 --> 03:08.470
Opening closing brackets saver's command an S and run us which is EF 5.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.090
So what's your name Tony.

03:10.190 --> 03:10.910
Lowercase.

03:11.040 --> 03:11.760
Hello Tony.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.690
Uppercase.

03:12.780 --> 03:13.490
Perfect.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.390
We'll come back to this import function later.

03:15.450 --> 03:18.660
But I just wanted to get you familiar with it because we're gonna be using it a lot in the lecture's

03:18.660 --> 03:19.170
ahead.

03:19.380 --> 03:19.770
Thank you.

03:19.770 --> 03:21.390
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
