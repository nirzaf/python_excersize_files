Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.680 --> 00:07.440
Today we're moving into a new section and that section is all about branching and conditions.

00:07.840 --> 00:15.310
So every day of our nine lives we make decisions log into our email or access Facebook or not to continue.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.530
Click this button buy a product.

00:17.530 --> 00:18.880
Or don't buy a product.

00:18.970 --> 00:21.760
In programming these decisions are called branching.

00:21.790 --> 00:25.700
Think of branching as a decision to take one road over another.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.920
Let's take a look at a quick example.

00:29.100 --> 00:33.570
Using our newly acquired knowledge of the INPUT statement let's create a password checker so that you

00:33.570 --> 00:37.740
can see here I vented in our usual comments and we're starting off with a print statement

00:41.190 --> 00:43.420
to continue.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.260
Please log in.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.950
OK simple enough clothes are double quotes.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.990
Close our brackets.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.260
Now we'll enter in a calm and

00:54.840 --> 00:56.150
using the if statement.

00:59.410 --> 01:01.050
Perfect.

01:01.170 --> 01:05.710
Now let's create a new variable called password which will hold the user's input and password.

01:05.990 --> 01:06.340
Import

01:11.680 --> 01:14.840
Please enter your password.

01:15.460 --> 01:21.100
OK so far nothing out of the blue.

01:21.180 --> 01:23.630
Now if password

01:27.830 --> 01:33.310
and we're using two equal signs an implied and that means if the password is identical.

01:33.370 --> 01:38.610
So not just similar not just almost absolutely identical.

01:38.710 --> 01:42.740
So that includes lower case number of characters everything.

01:42.820 --> 01:45.340
So if a password is identical to Tony

01:51.310 --> 01:59.220
access granted nice Ok open sesame access granted.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.310
Don't forget our closing quote here or else

02:05.190 --> 02:06.770
don't forget the code on there.

02:06.790 --> 02:07.070
Print

02:09.930 --> 02:10.470
incorrect

02:13.180 --> 02:16.910
please try again OK.

02:16.940 --> 02:19.720
Close or double quotes close or brackets.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.380
Let's have a look and run this program.

02:21.460 --> 02:22.590
But first we have to save.

02:22.660 --> 02:24.810
OK so here we are to continue please log in.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.870
Please enter your password.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.940
Let's go Tony.

02:29.050 --> 02:30.220
Access granted.

02:30.340 --> 02:31.440
Very very nice.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.360
OK let's run it again.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.190
Please enter your password.

02:38.190 --> 02:40.020
Let's try Frank.

02:40.110 --> 02:40.630
Incorrect.

02:40.650 --> 02:41.570
Please try again.

02:41.580 --> 02:46.320
This example has a couple of new concepts and in the next lecture we're going to be taking a much closer

02:46.320 --> 02:46.670
look.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.360
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
