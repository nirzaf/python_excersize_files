Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.570 --> 00:06.140
Now in the last lecture we used the if if else chain.

00:06.510 --> 00:12.200
And it's only appropriate to use this chain when you just need one test to pass when Piven finds one

00:12.200 --> 00:13.780
task that passes in your if.

00:13.790 --> 00:14.390
Elif.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.290
Else chain it skips the rest.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.810
But sometimes you'll need to check all of the conditions of interest when you need to do this.

00:20.810 --> 00:22.840
You can use a series of IF statements.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.780
This makes sense when more than one condition can and must be true.

00:26.990 --> 00:28.350
So let's look at an example.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.330
So let's first create a list.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.630
OK we're going to create a list called booking details.

00:35.670 --> 00:38.350
That's always open with square brackets.

00:38.360 --> 00:41.750
I'm going to give it the first value of Tony.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.400
This is a book in detail for a sentiment.

00:44.400 --> 00:44.900
Let's go.

00:44.900 --> 00:45.630
Miller wrote.

00:45.710 --> 00:53.810
Because I like sitting in the middle rope and we are going to be watching this film in a screen to OK

00:53.840 --> 00:54.490
perfect.

00:54.570 --> 00:59.410
And let's close off our list with a square bracket not a curly bracket no.

00:59.420 --> 01:06.920
So if Tony in booking details

01:17.410 --> 01:20.480
will come to you in the cinema.

01:21.370 --> 01:23.050
OK good stuff.

01:23.050 --> 01:27.700
Next if Middleboro

01:30.640 --> 01:31.800
in booking details

01:36.560 --> 01:48.420
we don't print your seat number is 0 1 0 in the middle row.

01:48.620 --> 01:53.900
Perfect So I think you get an idea of what we're doing here and there's nothing I closed out with that.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.850
There we go.

01:55.070 --> 02:05.320
And final final if Death Screen two in booking the towns

02:09.660 --> 02:10.050
print

02:13.050 --> 02:20.490
your film is in screen too and let's close it up.

02:20.490 --> 02:21.800
There we go.

02:22.710 --> 02:27.510
So we start off a list containing our users booking details the first IF statement checks to see if

02:27.510 --> 02:30.800
the person collecting the ticket is the person who booked it online.

02:30.800 --> 02:36.240
If so a message is printed welcoming them and our test continue our next if statement checks to see

02:36.240 --> 02:38.570
if the middle row was booked by the same user.

02:38.610 --> 02:44.230
If so our program continues the next test I would then check to make sure that the screen the box screen

02:44.230 --> 02:49.260
to is in our booking details so what we're doing here is we're checking all the details in our booking

02:49.260 --> 02:50.260
details list.

02:50.480 --> 02:53.720
I confirm during our test and each time they are confirmed.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.720
Our program continues the next test and so on and so on.

02:56.730 --> 02:58.550
So let's run this and see how it looks.

02:58.590 --> 03:04.610
Us we save and then we run walk me to the cinema.

03:04.680 --> 03:09.110
Your seat number 0 1 0 in the middle row your film is in screen too perfect.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.010
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
