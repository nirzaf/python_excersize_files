00:00.740 --> 00:02.380
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.630 --> 00:08.870
So far we've seen how less really the workhorse of pipe and we've seen the power of the if the else

00:09.020 --> 00:10.300
and the Aliff statements.

00:10.490 --> 00:12.970
Well how about combining all of these things together.

00:13.280 --> 00:17.060
Let's take a look at a type of online shopping cart as our example.

00:17.060 --> 00:21.110
So let's start off creating our shopping cart and our shopping cart is just a list of items that we

00:21.110 --> 00:28.120
have in our cart so we are adding a comment here to say creating our shopping cart

00:30.860 --> 00:31.320
OK.

00:31.330 --> 00:38.580
Next we create our list of shopping cart items so shopping cart clothes square brackets.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.630
Now let's populate our shopping cart pens

00:43.200 --> 00:44.340
paper.

00:44.960 --> 00:51.030
And as always each item in our list is separated by a common stapler.

00:51.390 --> 00:56.100
And finally let's add in some post-its because who doesn't like Post-its.

00:59.260 --> 01:04.270
Now we're going to do is for each item in a shopping cart we're going to add in a print message saying

01:04.570 --> 01:06.750
adding the item to our order.

01:06.790 --> 01:10.110
So that's our income and here's what we know what we're doing.

01:12.160 --> 01:20.370
And I think each item to an order as we go and let's start this off the for statement.

01:20.540 --> 01:27.310
So for Item four items in our shopping cart.

01:27.470 --> 01:31.730
OK so for each of our items in shopping cart we want to print.

01:31.730 --> 01:43.040
So open up a double quote adding space close to the quote Plus item plus open double quotes space to

01:43.040 --> 01:48.310
your order OK and let's close that up put our brackets.

01:49.940 --> 01:53.710
And then we close this off with a print statement telling the user that the order is complete.

01:53.720 --> 01:54.320
So print

01:57.590 --> 02:00.020
your order is complete.

02:00.020 --> 02:05.570
So imagine you're on something like Amazon.com and you're clicking away and pans paper stapler and then

02:05.660 --> 02:09.500
you click checkout and you'll get a message saying your order is complete.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.070
We're doing a very simple version of that to our terminal at your code here.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.480
OK.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.020
So let's run this and see what we get.

02:16.020 --> 02:17.370
First we save it.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.020
Here we go.

02:18.040 --> 02:22.410
Now let's run adding Pansie order paper.

02:22.450 --> 02:23.480
Stay posted.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.490
Your order is complete perfect so that's what we want.

02:25.490 --> 02:26.840
Very simple.

02:26.840 --> 02:30.920
Now what happens when one of our items in our list could be our stock.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.120
How would we deal with that.

02:32.360 --> 02:38.240
So you have to imagine again that we have a shopping cart list and copy another list in our program

02:38.360 --> 02:43.120
which we'll look at later which could be a list of our stock items sort of somebody else in the office.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.490
And every time an item is out of stock they're all taking that list.

02:46.700 --> 02:51.500
So let's have a look at how we deal with an item that's out of stock we can use an if statement inside

02:51.500 --> 02:52.480
a for loop.

02:52.550 --> 02:54.270
So let's do that now.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.270
So inside a for loop.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.650
And as you mentioned before indentation is very important in writing.

02:58.760 --> 03:03.400
So if item I'm going to say that pens are out of stock.

03:03.850 --> 03:07.160
So if the item is pends pans

03:11.520 --> 03:14.310
Sorry that's a spelling mistake there.

03:14.340 --> 03:16.160
Spary sorry

03:19.000 --> 03:22.260
that item is out of stock.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.220
OK.

03:23.230 --> 03:24.220
Simple enough.

03:24.220 --> 03:26.610
Let's close off a double called Koser bracket.

03:27.310 --> 03:32.470
Now order wise else we have in our print print.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.940
Adding the item to our order.

03:35.530 --> 03:40.660
This time we check each order item before adding it to our current or if statement checks to see if

03:40.660 --> 03:42.240
our user has ordered pens.

03:42.340 --> 03:45.230
If they have them we display a message saying the pens are out of stock.

03:45.280 --> 03:53.950
So let's have a look at how that would work and save and run that we go our first our first item is

03:53.950 --> 03:55.490
pens and we get the message.

03:55.490 --> 03:59.340
Sorry that item is out-of-stock not bad.

03:59.340 --> 04:03.520
Very simple online ordering system or the bones of one anyway.

04:03.570 --> 04:06.720
Now there will come a time when we will be working with empty lists.

04:06.750 --> 04:11.910
After all if we are creating a shopping cart we don't know in advance what our user is going to put

04:11.910 --> 04:13.500
in and what they're going to buy.

04:13.500 --> 04:17.270
So our list obviously will be empty at the very beginning of our program.

04:17.400 --> 04:22.740
So let's stick to our shopping cart example and check whether the list shopping cart is empty before

04:22.740 --> 04:24.150
proceeding to the checkout.

04:24.420 --> 04:29.220
If the list is empty We'll tell you it that they need to add an item to the cart before proceeding.

04:29.220 --> 04:33.210
If the list is not empty we proceed with the order just as we did in the previous example.

04:33.510 --> 04:34.820
So let's do that now.

04:35.060 --> 04:36.120
Let me clear off here.

04:39.780 --> 04:44.160
And we're just going to update that update this comment here because this is going to be a new program

04:47.650 --> 04:56.360
working with the lists perfect So let's first create an empty list.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.170
Empty shopping cart

05:04.150 --> 05:09.670
cake shopping cart equals.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.560
And as we saw before and empty this has created just two square brackets.

05:13.740 --> 05:16.650
Now if shopping cart

05:21.020 --> 05:30.430
for item and shopping cart What are we going to do now here.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.400
Well we're going to do is we're going to print

05:36.000 --> 05:47.650
I think very similar to last time plus item plus broken brackets plus double quotes space to your cart

05:48.710 --> 05:50.450
those that are of brackets.

05:50.610 --> 05:51.250
OK.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.320
Otherwise we print

05:57.150 --> 05:59.870
your order is complete

06:04.100 --> 06:05.110
no or else

06:12.840 --> 06:26.320
you must select an item before proceeding.

06:26.740 --> 06:29.200
OK so what are we doing let's have a quick look.

06:29.310 --> 06:30.940
We create an empty shopping cart here.

06:32.330 --> 06:33.810
Now we've opened up an if statement.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.460
So if our shopping cart.

06:35.550 --> 06:39.340
So for item in our shopping cart print adding item to our order.

06:39.350 --> 06:41.530
But as we know our shopping cart is empty.

06:42.550 --> 06:44.610
If it's not empty we get to print a message.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.020
Your order is complete but it is empty.

06:47.050 --> 06:48.600
So we get the message.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.550
You must select an item before proceeding.

06:50.620 --> 06:51.660
So we're checking that.

06:51.670 --> 06:54.500
So let's just say this and let's run it.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.620
You must select an item before proceeding.

06:58.620 --> 07:02.530
OK let's modify that slightly and add an item into a shopping cart.

07:02.570 --> 07:10.850
So let's add in pends savings and run us adding Pansey your card.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.050
Your order is complete.

07:12.050 --> 07:12.800
So you go.

07:12.870 --> 07:17.970
A very simple example of how we can check if an item is in a list or not and how to use the L statement

07:18.180 --> 07:23.040
the if statement and a for statement all together to create a shopping cart example.

07:23.200 --> 07:28.220
I hope we found this helpful if not please let me know and ask any questions you would like.

07:28.260 --> 07:29.910
Q And a section of this lecture.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.500
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
