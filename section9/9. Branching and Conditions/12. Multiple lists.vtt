00:02.350 --> 00:04.320
Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:04.390 --> 00:08.210
Now in a previous example we specified a particular item that was out-of-stock.

00:08.290 --> 00:12.220
So we specified that pens were out of stock but doesn't mention there will come a time when we're able

00:12.220 --> 00:15.160
to pull in or out of stock items from another list.

00:15.160 --> 00:21.460
So in this example we're going to use to list a list of items in our shopping cart and a list of I and

00:21.460 --> 00:23.490
a list about the stock items.

00:23.530 --> 00:27.060
So as you can see here I've started off some comments and that created two tulis.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.260
So go ahead and create those lists now.

00:31.070 --> 00:31.710
OK.

00:31.810 --> 00:36.510
In the example to come each item in a shopping cart is checked against our list of out-of-stock items.

00:36.520 --> 00:42.130
So let's take a look at how we do that we have to list our first list is our in-stock items on our second

00:42.130 --> 00:43.650
list is our shopping cart.

00:43.990 --> 00:50.680
So as you can see here our user has requested orange post-its which is not in our in-stock list.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.730
So let's get meet ever code of our program running.

00:54.220 --> 00:58.760
So for item in shopping cart

01:02.510 --> 01:10.820
inside the loop we first check to see if each item our user wants to buy is in-stock if item in in-stock

01:14.350 --> 01:15.760
if the item is in stock.

01:15.760 --> 01:19.870
We print the message like in the last lecture which tells the user that we're adding the item to the

01:19.870 --> 01:20.540
list.

01:20.540 --> 01:20.870
Print

01:26.080 --> 01:32.680
plus item plus to your order.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.390
Perfect.

01:35.430 --> 01:36.980
Close that off.

01:36.990 --> 01:39.840
Else print

01:43.380 --> 01:55.480
sorry plus item plus OpenTable quote is not in stock

01:59.280 --> 02:11.950
close that off and we finish up with a print statement print your order is complete.

02:12.460 --> 02:12.820
OK.

02:12.850 --> 02:13.900
There we go.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.380
So let's have a look what we've done.

02:15.430 --> 02:18.340
First we've Crighton in-stock list which contains three items.

02:18.340 --> 02:20.750
Blue pens paper and staples.

02:20.770 --> 02:27.430
Next we have our users shopping cart and they've opted to buy blue pants paper staples and orange Post-its.

02:27.430 --> 02:32.680
Plus we know orange post-its are not in our stock list for block.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.630
We have four item in our shopping cart so for each item in our shopping cart do the following.

02:37.990 --> 02:43.590
If the item is in our in-stock list print adding the item to your order else.

02:43.630 --> 02:50.270
So if the item is not in stock list print sorry item is not in stock when our 4 block is complete.

02:50.350 --> 02:53.260
We run our print statement here which says your order is complete.

02:53.350 --> 02:57.930
So let's say this and then run it.

02:57.990 --> 03:01.000
Here we go adding blue pens you order adding paper to your order.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.100
Staples your order.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.380
Sorry orange post that is not in stock.

03:04.410 --> 03:05.450
Your order is complete.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.080
Perfect.

03:07.140 --> 03:10.770
So there we have an example of how we can use multiple lists in our programs.

03:10.770 --> 03:12.480
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
