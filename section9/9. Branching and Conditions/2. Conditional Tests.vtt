Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:01.650 --> 00:05.700
Now as you can see here we're using partons Idol Shelfer this lecture and that's because we want instant

00:05.700 --> 00:08.590
feedback from what we're going to be doing during the lecture.

00:08.650 --> 00:14.250
So we were introduced briefly in the last lecture the Titans statement and every IF statement is like

00:14.250 --> 00:17.470
a test and these tests are called conditional test.

00:17.520 --> 00:23.420
And that's because each test can be evaluated as either true or false depending on the conditions within

00:23.430 --> 00:23.960
them.

00:24.390 --> 00:29.310
If a conditional test evaluates the true pipe and executes the code following the if statement.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.380
If the test evaluates to false and ignores the code following the if statement.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.640
The simplest conditional test checks whether the value of a variable is equal to the value of interest.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.250
So let's take a look.

00:40.330 --> 00:42.980
That's quite new very variable called Password.

00:43.020 --> 00:45.960
Let's get at the value of Tony.

00:46.020 --> 00:47.880
Perfect.

00:47.880 --> 00:55.020
Now let's compare and see if our value within password which is Tony is equal to Tony which would come

00:55.020 --> 01:00.690
from user input and it is to as we've seen plenty of times before is assigned a value of Tony to the

01:00.690 --> 01:06.840
variable password a double equal sign is called the equality operator the equality operator returns

01:06.840 --> 01:11.280
true if the values on both sides of it match and false if they don't match.

01:11.280 --> 01:17.010
So for example here we know that the value on the left hand side of the equality operator password contains

01:17.010 --> 01:17.910
the value.

01:17.910 --> 01:19.210
Tony.

01:19.470 --> 01:22.830
And on the right hand side if you call the operator we have Toney's.

01:22.890 --> 01:29.020
So we press Enter we are returned true because both sides only call the operator are equal to each other.

01:29.190 --> 01:34.350
When you are testing for equality implied in case matters two values with different capitalization are

01:34.350 --> 01:35.610
not considered equal.

01:35.610 --> 01:36.530
So let's take a look.

01:37.430 --> 01:43.170
Password is equal to Tony with a capital T.

01:43.420 --> 01:47.760
And we know that's going to be false because we know our password is Tony with alacrity false.

01:47.870 --> 01:49.270
OK so far so good.

01:49.300 --> 01:55.460
If the case matters like Windows or using a password or a sign in form that this behavior is very useful

01:55.990 --> 02:00.580
but if it doesn't matter then you need to compare the variables value to lowercase before conducting

02:00.580 --> 02:01.410
your tests.

02:01.420 --> 02:04.190
And let's take a look now at how we would do it at first.

02:04.210 --> 02:10.040
Let's create a new password password 1 and that's the sign at the value.

02:10.150 --> 02:16.850
Frank would an upper case f great.

02:16.860 --> 02:18.440
Now let's take that value.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.290
And apply our lower case method.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.850
And compare it to Frank

02:30.460 --> 02:31.230
true.

02:31.240 --> 02:37.540
So here we can see we've taken the value Frank with an upper case f we've lowered it and compared it

02:37.540 --> 02:39.400
to Frank with a lowercase F..

02:39.490 --> 02:41.520
And we've gotten the result of true.

02:41.590 --> 02:46.120
So this has been a brief introduction into conditional test and the if statement in particular and we'll

02:46.110 --> 02:49.000
look how to use that in bigger programs in the next lecture.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.860
Thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
