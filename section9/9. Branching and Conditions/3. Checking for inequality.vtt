Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:03.030 --> 00:05.970
Now we've just learned how to check for a quality of two items.

00:06.120 --> 00:10.520
But what about when we want to check if two values are not equal to each other.

00:10.530 --> 00:14.290
Truth is we can combine an exclamation mark and an equal sign.

00:15.710 --> 00:21.860
As it does in many programming language the exclamation mark represents not that's not an example.

00:22.490 --> 00:31.330
So in idle Let's go new file let's just make that large Let's save this as

00:34.890 --> 00:40.260
birthday.

00:40.260 --> 00:40.750
There we go.

00:40.760 --> 00:41.460
Saved.

00:41.670 --> 00:42.030
OK.

00:42.040 --> 00:48.180
So my underscore birthday equals November

00:56.030 --> 00:57.680
my birthday.

00:59.380 --> 01:00.790
Is not equal to

01:04.700 --> 01:05.720
march.

01:08.910 --> 01:09.510
Then print

01:13.710 --> 01:16.950
it not your birthday.

01:21.930 --> 01:22.800
Let me just correct that.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.430
That should be a double quote instead of a single.

01:25.850 --> 01:30.360
And let's run this so you'll save it.

01:32.730 --> 01:33.570
What's this error.

01:33.580 --> 01:36.170
Now let's just correct this and just left out the quote.

01:36.190 --> 01:37.690
And let's run it again.

01:40.070 --> 01:45.120
It's not your birthday and that's because the minute the value assigned to my birthday is November and

01:45.140 --> 01:48.070
we have given it marked We're checking if it's March.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.190
OK so I hope that helps.

01:49.190 --> 01:51.550
And that's how you check for I suppose inequality.

01:51.590 --> 01:55.220
How to check if two items are not equal to each other and see you in the next lecture.

01:55.220 --> 01:57.790
When will we be looking at numerical comparisons.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.190
Thank you.
