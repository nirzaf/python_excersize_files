Hi everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be looking at numerical comparisons.

00:05.090 --> 00:08.920
So how to compare numbers with each other when it comes to comparing numbers.

00:08.930 --> 00:14.070
It makes it pretty simple that age equals 18.

00:14.240 --> 00:19.600
And as you can see we don't surround the 8 digits in single or double quotes because they're numbers.

00:19.730 --> 00:25.000
We only do that with strings age equals 18.

00:25.040 --> 00:25.510
True.

00:25.580 --> 00:26.510
Perfect.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.920
We can also test to see if two numbers are not equal to each other.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.510
And the way we do that is let's just pop open a new file

00:35.490 --> 00:35.830
for us.

00:35.830 --> 00:44.340
Let's save this save as this top and save it as numbers and I'll just replace what I have there.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.250
The place.

00:45.260 --> 00:45.730
Perfect.

00:45.800 --> 00:49.530
OK so let's say age equals 23.

00:50.420 --> 00:54.770
If age is not equal to 22.

00:54.840 --> 01:01.100
So somebody's birthday who is 22 not 23 percent

01:04.160 --> 01:04.770
sorry.

01:04.790 --> 01:08.140
No cake for you which is a bit mean.

01:08.150 --> 01:10.210
But anyway it makes our point.

01:10.220 --> 01:11.330
And let's say that.

01:11.430 --> 01:17.060
Now let's run us.

01:17.330 --> 01:18.410
And there we go.

01:18.410 --> 01:18.800
Sorry.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.380
No cake for you.

01:20.390 --> 01:23.520
We can also use several mathematical comparisons in our statements.

01:23.720 --> 01:24.460
Let's have a look at it.

01:24.470 --> 01:26.380
So we've already seen the equal sign.

01:26.630 --> 01:28.360
Now what about less than.

01:28.810 --> 01:31.550
So we give an age the value of 21.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.990
So age is less than the value 21 favs.

01:36.290 --> 01:40.360
OK let's say age graded and 21.

01:40.700 --> 01:45.330
How about age less than or equal to 21.

01:45.350 --> 01:46.250
True.

01:46.250 --> 01:46.940
Perfect.

01:46.940 --> 01:52.150
How about age greater than or equal to 21.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.860
True because the age is equal to 21.

01:54.920 --> 02:00.080
That's it for this lovely short lecture on numerical comparisons and we look at these later on in future

02:00.090 --> 02:00.590
lectures.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.160
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
