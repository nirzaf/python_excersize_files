Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.220 --> 00:07.260
Now sometimes you are going to want to check if multiple conditions are true because so far we've only

00:07.260 --> 00:08.780
been looking at single conditions.

00:08.820 --> 00:15.170
If one thing is true or not true for example we might want to check if a username and password are true.

00:15.180 --> 00:20.490
Let's look at how the check of two conditions are true if each test passes then the overall expression

00:20.640 --> 00:23.610
or our program will evaluate to true.

00:23.610 --> 00:28.980
So let's start here with a user name and you can already see I've entered in some comments as identifying

00:28.980 --> 00:30.670
the program in part

00:33.280 --> 00:33.790
welcome

00:38.270 --> 00:41.080
please enter your username

00:43.840 --> 00:49.690
OK so that's our first one and let's create a variable password and put

00:53.610 --> 00:58.970
Oh please enter your password.

00:59.570 --> 01:00.170
OK.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.640
Let's just close that off.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.750
If use a name

01:06.080 --> 01:07.650
be helpful if I spelt it right.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.470
Because otherwise nothing is going to work.

01:09.690 --> 01:12.330
If your name is not Tony

01:15.920 --> 01:26.140
and our password is not password 1 2 3 It wouldn't be very hard to hack.

01:26.260 --> 01:29.670
This was a real program print

01:34.500 --> 01:36.630
Access Denied

01:40.280 --> 01:41.710
else.

01:41.830 --> 01:47.230
Don't forget your code on prent.

01:47.400 --> 01:47.790
Welcome

01:50.870 --> 01:51.650
OK.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.390
So I've already saved this file.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.030
So let's run it and see what we get.

01:56.350 --> 02:01.210
Welcome please enter your username username Tony present your password.

02:01.210 --> 02:03.150
P A S S W O already.

02:03.170 --> 02:04.540
One two three.

02:04.750 --> 02:05.320
Welcome.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.240
There we go.

02:06.250 --> 02:10.420
So two conditions are true and our program has run.

02:10.420 --> 02:11.750
Let's try this again.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.780
Present our username Frank password p a.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.960
SS access denied.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.140
So Bodor conditions are incorrect.

02:23.150 --> 02:25.570
So if so our program evaluates to false.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.860
OK let's just step through this program for a moment.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.830
Here we have the lines.

02:31.830 --> 02:36.870
Suppose one and two we ask the user to input their user name and password.

02:36.870 --> 02:43.990
Then we create an if statement and we Calpine that if the username does not equal Tony and the password

02:43.990 --> 02:51.920
does not equal password 1 2 3 then print access is denied as long as the user input and the password

02:52.100 --> 02:54.380
equal Tony and password 1 2 3.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.900
Then the program is a success.

02:56.900 --> 03:01.860
Print welcome and that's how we test for multiple conditions using the current condition.

03:03.020 --> 03:06.340
We look at this later on in furter lectures and bigger programs.

03:06.650 --> 03:08.390
Thank you for listening and I see you in the next lecture.
