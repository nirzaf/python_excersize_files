Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.720 --> 00:07.640
Now we've just seen how we can check conditions using the on statement and for the statement to pass

00:07.970 --> 00:09.280
or to run a program.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.590
Both conditions have to be true.

00:11.660 --> 00:16.790
We can also use what's called the or key word which allows us to check multiple conditions.

00:16.940 --> 00:23.120
But it passes when either or both of the individual tests pass and or expression fails only when both

00:23.150 --> 00:24.540
individual tests fail.

00:24.770 --> 00:26.320
Let's look at an example.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.630
So we're going to check some pages here.

00:28.670 --> 00:37.620
So your age equals import.

00:37.650 --> 00:40.750
How old are you.

00:40.830 --> 00:41.430
Perfect.

00:41.430 --> 00:42.630
Let's just close that up.

00:43.880 --> 00:49.090
And your friends age and I was always a little typo in my spelling.

00:49.160 --> 00:55.680
Friends age equals import.

00:55.820 --> 00:59.190
How old is your friend.

01:02.580 --> 01:06.900
And again close with her double quote on our bracket.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.370
So now we're going to create an IF block.

01:09.460 --> 01:13.690
But first is just something we need to address because we're asking here for ages and people are going

01:13.690 --> 01:17.720
to import digits those digits are going to be received by Payden as strings.

01:17.890 --> 01:22.750
So we need to convert them into integers for our programs to run and not generate any errors.

01:22.750 --> 01:27.220
So if in your age

01:31.770 --> 01:37.430
is greater than or equal to 18 or friends age

01:41.540 --> 01:43.690
is greater than or equal to 18.

01:43.700 --> 01:56.020
Don't forget our on print and Grotz one of you is old enough to vote

02:00.640 --> 02:02.720
OK else

02:07.000 --> 02:09.800
print.

02:09.950 --> 02:16.080
Sorry one of you is too young to vote.

02:18.450 --> 02:21.060
We start by asking to use the input to ages.

02:21.060 --> 02:26.910
We don't want to check using the organization to see if both of our ages are greater than or equal to

02:26.910 --> 02:27.900
18.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.210
Let's run this program now and see how it looks.

02:30.210 --> 02:33.640
First we'll save it and then we run.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.540
So how will you.

02:35.580 --> 02:36.990
So let's say I'm 18.

02:36.990 --> 02:37.940
I wish I were.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.190
How old is your friend.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.220
Eighteen.

02:40.320 --> 02:40.830
Congrats.

02:40.830 --> 02:44.550
One of you is old enough to vote country boat art has a pass.

02:44.580 --> 02:49.750
So as we said from the beginning and or expression fails only when both individual tests fail.

02:49.950 --> 02:53.180
Let's run this again and not fail both tests.

02:54.690 --> 02:55.590
So will you.

02:55.650 --> 02:56.860
16.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.120
How old is your friend.

02:58.150 --> 02:58.930
17.

02:59.040 --> 02:59.600
Sorry.

02:59.700 --> 03:04.020
One of you is too young to vote and we've left out a word here.

03:04.020 --> 03:06.220
Too young to vote so we correct that now.

03:07.590 --> 03:09.480
So hope that explains the statement.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.640
And like others will be using it when we get into more advanced topics.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.540
Later on during the course.

03:14.940 --> 03:16.770
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
