Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.060 --> 00:05.920
Now in this lecture we're going to look at how to check if a value is not in a list.

00:05.940 --> 00:08.530
So sometimes you need to know when the value is not in the list.

00:08.550 --> 00:14.610
Again consider the example of a web app you could have to list for different users admin users and normal

00:14.610 --> 00:15.160
users.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.230
Obviously admin users can do more than the normal users.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.340
So let's have a look at how that would work.

00:20.340 --> 00:22.600
So let's first create a list of admin users.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.730
And let's call this admin users.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.680
Nice and simple.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.540
He calls let's just give this to users.

00:34.640 --> 00:39.940
Tony and frank here we go.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.960
We've created a list of users now that asked to use for our username

00:48.310 --> 00:49.490
and let's have a look.

00:49.500 --> 00:54.270
User name equals input

00:58.690 --> 01:02.680
please enter your user name.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.740
OK close it off.

01:05.740 --> 01:06.430
Perfect.

01:06.430 --> 01:19.500
Next we check if the username entered is in our list of adman's.

01:19.520 --> 01:32.720
So if user name not so here's the key word here not in admin users colon print

01:36.810 --> 01:40.010
you do not have access.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.910
OK else print

01:46.030 --> 01:47.130
access granted

01:51.470 --> 01:51.770
OK.

01:51.770 --> 01:55.520
So what we've done is we've created a list of admin users with just two users.

01:55.520 --> 02:01.220
We've then asked the user input the user name if the user name is not in our list of our main users.

02:01.310 --> 02:05.840
Well then we don't grant access to whatever it is or trying to do or otherwise you print out access

02:05.840 --> 02:06.950
granted.

02:06.950 --> 02:08.080
So let's save this.

02:08.290 --> 02:09.740
And now let's run it.

02:12.350 --> 02:12.850
OK.

02:13.010 --> 02:15.610
Please enter your username Tony.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.050
Access granted.

02:17.150 --> 02:18.080
So far so good.

02:18.140 --> 02:19.100
Let's run it again.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.120
Present your news name.

02:24.460 --> 02:30.690
Bobby As you can see I'm expanding out on my list of user names from my usual Frank.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.140
Tony.

02:31.150 --> 02:33.540
Mary you do not have access.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.310
So there we go.

02:34.320 --> 02:38.850
So you can see how we can combine that with the last letter to start checking for valid users and user

02:38.850 --> 02:41.700
names put in your web app or any other application.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.380
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
