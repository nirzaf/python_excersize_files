Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:02.190 --> 00:07.350
Now they are gonna be many times when you need to test more than two possible situations and to do this

00:07.530 --> 00:11.720
we can use an if if else block.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.590
Let's take a look at an example.

00:13.840 --> 00:19.800
So consider an online banking application that tells you what your interest rate is based on your balance.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.290
First we ask the user for the balance.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.420
Let's start off income and get use or balance.

00:26.790 --> 00:27.360
OK.

00:27.600 --> 00:32.450
Then we ask the user for her actual balance balance equals in part

00:35.490 --> 00:36.660
opened double quote.

00:36.750 --> 00:39.870
What is your bank balance.

00:42.290 --> 00:43.200
Question mark.

00:43.200 --> 00:48.350
First of all quote close brackets if he uses bank balance is less than 50 dollars that they did not

00:48.350 --> 00:55.920
qualify to earn interest if integer because of user input that we got back will be a string balance.

00:55.940 --> 01:00.530
I'm going to use our comparison's operators here now what we saw in a previous lecture is less than

01:00.530 --> 01:04.160
or equal to 50.

01:04.170 --> 01:09.100
Don't forget your code which I nearly did print.

01:09.590 --> 01:14.710
You do not qualify for interest

01:19.840 --> 01:24.510
perfect or if to use his bank bounds is less than one dollars but more than $50.

01:24.610 --> 01:26.950
Then they qualify for one percent interest.

01:26.950 --> 01:32.870
Finally if you use it bounds is over $100 and they get 2 percent interest.

01:32.890 --> 01:34.190
So let's add that in there.

01:34.450 --> 01:45.620
So if balance is less than 100.

01:46.030 --> 01:47.050
Your interest.

01:47.050 --> 01:55.800
Actually I've forgotten my opening double quote here so your interest rate is 1 percent.

01:55.830 --> 01:57.600
Close your double quotes.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.790
Close your bracket.

01:59.910 --> 02:00.330
Else

02:03.410 --> 02:03.860
print

02:08.580 --> 02:09.480
your interest

02:13.180 --> 02:15.710
rate is 2 percent.

02:16.340 --> 02:16.980
OK.

02:17.230 --> 02:20.550
We can use as many blocks as we like in our code.

02:21.510 --> 02:23.690
So let's run this now and see what happens.

02:23.700 --> 02:28.160
First we have to say that command an S and then run.

02:28.240 --> 02:28.950
OK so here we go.

02:28.950 --> 02:31.890
What does your bank balance my bank balance is $10.

02:31.980 --> 02:34.050
You do not qualify for an interest rate.

02:34.230 --> 02:34.650
OK.

02:34.650 --> 02:36.160
That's unfortunate.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.230
So let's say I've made a deposit run Mudgal.

02:39.470 --> 02:45.430
What does your bank balance my bank balance is $51 your interest rate is 1 percent.

02:45.590 --> 02:46.350
OK.

02:46.660 --> 02:52.720
Let's run it one more time and have a look my bank balance is $102.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.620
Your interest rate is 2 percent.

02:54.820 --> 02:55.730
Okay perfect.

02:55.730 --> 02:58.880
So let's just go back to our program and step over this for a second.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.200
First we are so used to our balance.

03:01.220 --> 03:02.710
So what does your bank balance.

03:02.750 --> 03:08.080
And we wait for the user's input if their balance is less than 50 or less than or equal to $50.

03:08.150 --> 03:13.250
So I think from 50 dollars down to zero you do not qualify for interest.

03:13.250 --> 03:19.350
Now then we say out if Al if indeed your balance is less than 100.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.370
But we've already caught anything from 50 downwards.

03:22.490 --> 03:26.970
So this catches anything from 50 upwards but not greater than 100.

03:26.990 --> 03:34.200
Your interest rate is 1 percent and then else what we're saying here is anything over 100 is 2 percent.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.550
So I hope that makes sense.

03:36.710 --> 03:40.740
Let's expand on this program now and not another half block.

03:40.940 --> 03:46.280
So we're going to modify this here and we're going to say if the balance is zero we're going to print

03:48.900 --> 03:52.530
would you like to make a deposit.

03:54.370 --> 03:59.040
Close close close that and then we're going to put our first what was previously our first print statement

03:59.280 --> 04:12.870
into an atlas if and balance after the teeter and balance is less than or equal to 50 than we print.

04:12.950 --> 04:14.670
You do not qualify for interest.

04:14.810 --> 04:15.230
Okay.

04:15.230 --> 04:16.200
So let's run this again.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.120
First we save it and let's run it now.

04:20.090 --> 04:21.440
What does your bank balance.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.700
Well my balance is zero.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.080
Would you like to make a deposit.

04:24.110 --> 04:24.840
Perfect.

04:24.950 --> 04:27.160
At the end of our program there is an Alice block.

04:27.230 --> 04:28.200
So here it is here.

04:28.330 --> 04:30.970
Platon doesn't actually need an ounce block at the end of it.

04:31.140 --> 04:36.500
If it's changed by closing our program or else we are using it as a kind of catch all statement for

04:36.500 --> 04:41.830
anything over the 100 dollar mark and applying an interest rate of 2 percent that we are saying the

04:41.830 --> 04:46.640
plight and that anyone with a balance of over 100 dollars gets the interest of 2 percent.

04:46.850 --> 04:52.550
Sometimes we'll make more sense to end with an If statement that catches a specific condition of your

04:52.550 --> 04:53.980
program.

04:53.990 --> 04:55.010
Now I hope this makes sense.

04:55.020 --> 04:58.640
I'm going to be coming back to this program in later lectures and expanding on it.

04:58.850 --> 05:01.820
If you've any questions as always don't hesitate to reach out.

05:01.820 --> 05:03.720
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
